We’re extremely excited to share this new primitive.<p>Besides the technical challenges building this project that folks here would find interesting (fixing the ZK proof compiler, modifying nodeJS V8 params etc.), we think this is a very novel use case for ZK tech, and ECDSA inside ZK-SNARKs is a starting point that unlocks many other ideas! :D<p>A summarized version of our README, with more thoughts on why you would want to enable this in the first place, is also in this Twitter thread[3]!<p>[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hacklodge.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hacklodge.org</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;0xparc.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;0xparc.org</a><p>[3]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;0xparc&#x2F;status&#x2F;1493363943036923912\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;0xparc&#x2F;status&#x2F;1493363943036923912</a>",
