        'Hi HN,<p>We (myself, Adhyyan1252 and yush_g) are undergrad students that hacked out this side project last month during Hack Lodge[1] (the ideas and many of the underlying circuits for which came from the 0xPARC community[2])! We’re extremely excited to share this new primitive.<p>Besides the technical challenges building this project that folks here would find interesting (fixing the ZK proof compiler, modifying nodeJS V8 params etc.), we think this is a very novel use case for ZK tech, and ECDSA inside ZK-SNARKs is a starting point that unlocks many other ideas! :D<p>A summarized version of our README, with more thoughts on why you would want to enable this in the first place, is also in this Twitter thread[3]!<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hacklodge.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hacklodge.org</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;0xparc.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;0xparc.org</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;0xparc&#x2F;status&#x2F;1493363943036923912" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;0xparc&#x2F;status&#x2F;1493363943036923912</a>',

      url: 'https://schemafreesql.com/',
      author: 'dfragnito',
      points: 45,
      story_text:
        'Hi HN, we&#x27;re Eric and Dean, creators of SchemafreeSQL. Its roots go back to an on-line Web App Development Environment we developed back in 1999. It was comprised of an IDE, Web Server, Object Store, Virtual File System, Template System, and polyglot (Java, JavaScript, and Python). Of course, we named it “.OS”. Then we ended up dropping it. But that&#x27;s a story for another time. It was the ease of use of the Object Store from .OS that we really missed, which brings us back to SchemafreeSQL. It provides an enhanced API to your SQL Database which allows it to function as a Schemaless Objectstore. Yes, &quot;Schemaless Objectstore&quot; might be an oxymoron if you consider that objects have strict &quot;schemas&quot;. So what are we talking about here?<p>It started with a simple goal. We wanted to store data just as simply as one could throw a JSON document into a doc store, but while maintaining the power of the data&#x27;s relations and references in an object sense.<p>What we ended up with was a JSON over HTTP API (for ubiquitous access from any language), that maps any JSON structure into an optimized, static set of indexed tables in any SQL database (MySQL being our first port). Using it, we can immediately store any data we want, without having to create tables and indexes and optimize them.<p>Inserting data is as easy as sending a JSON doc to a doc store, but in SFSQL all nested relations inherent within that document are stored as objects and primitives. And, with a little extra JSON syntax we can use references and eliminate duplication of data (e.g. &quot;#ref&quot;: &quot;oid-goes-here&quot;), all from within the same source JSON doc. There is also no added speed penalty for referencing an object. In fact, all parent nodes in the JSON source data are stored as objects. So any object can be referenced from anywhere, allowing for complex relations (e.g. any-to-any), enabling rapid prototyping of data structures (no tables to create), and enabling unique on-the-fly relations if need be.<p>Queries are issued using JOIN-free SQL query syntax (e.g. SELECT COUNT(*) WHERE $s:person.address.state=&#x27;NY&#x27;) that eliminates the verbosity of the standard SQL JOIN, yet still maintains access to the primitive and aggregate functions of the underlying SQL database (e.g. FORMAT(), COUNT(), etc.) which simply get passed through.<p>What it&#x27;s not? It&#x27;s not a database on it&#x27;s own and it&#x27;s not a horizontally scalable big data store. Although, since it can extend practically any SQL database, it&#x27;s ability to scale is in large part tied to the scaling ability of the chosen SQL database that it&#x27;s extending. It&#x27;s also not an ORM as there is no strict mapping of objects in code to objects in the datastore. And yes, there were trade offs in it&#x27;s design. One design choice was that every primitive be indexed, which results in better performance than against a straight SQL table without the proper indexes, though slower than a straight SQL table with a composite index tailored to that query. But, the ability to JOIN to an existing SQL table within a SFSQL query is on the roadmap which will allow you have the best of both worlds (custom tables w&#x2F;custom indexes referenced from within a SFSQL query). As well, there is a situation one encounters in indexing choices (but that you won&#x27;t encounter with SFSQL) that we like to call the &quot;Index Permutation Limitation&quot;. Simply put, there is a real limit to the number of composite indexes that you can create for any table&#x2F;collection. This is especially a problem when - for instance - you want to give end users the ability to query across any of the possible attributes across the myriad product types that a big online store may carry. We get into detail on this point within our FAQ.<p>So what it is? \nIt&#x27;s an extension to SQL databases that makes storing and querying and modeling and just generally using a datastore... easier. We&#x27;re hoping it will stir up some interesting use-cases.<p>Thanks in advance for the feedback!',

        'Hello everyone!<p>I&#x27;ve been working on a solution that will allow me to write my front-end application in PHP. Why? - I wouldn&#x27;t say I liked the idea of using Node js on my servers for server-side rendering using Vue or Angular. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I work with .NET, Node js, Angular, and React every day at work and have nothing against it. But I needed a simple component with some data from a server and rendered using a template for my side-project. So, I started to think, can I convert my PHP code into Javascript? - Sure I can. Classes will become functions, private properties - local variables. Protected and the public will become public properties, etc. Something like this:<p>class TodoApp extends BaseComponent\n{\n    public string $text = &#x27;&#x27;;\n    public array $items = [];<p><pre><code>    public function handleSubmit()\n    {\n        $this-&gt;items[] = $this-&gt;text;\n        $this-&gt;text = &#x27;&#x27;;\n    }</code></pre>\n}<p>will become:\nvar TodoApp = function () {\n    var $this = this;\n    this.text = &#x27;&#x27;;\n    this.items = [];<p><pre><code>    this.handleSubmit = function (event) {\n        $this.items.push($this.text);\n        $this.text = &#x27;&#x27;;\n    };</code></pre>\n};<p>By following that pattern, I designed a first working prototype. It was pretty good but most important - it supported SSR out of the box. Later I added more and more features, like templating engine, reactivity, built-in PHP functions support, etc. And I could not stop. I continue improving it every day in my free time. As of today, Viewi is a fully functional tool for building full-stack and reactive web applications.<p>Link with some examples:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;viewi.net&#x2F;<p>Documentation\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;viewi.net&#x2F;docs<p>Architecture design and idea\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;viewi.net&#x2F;docs&#x2F;architecture\nand here\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;viewi.net&#x2F;docs&#x2F;introduction<p>Tutorial\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;viewi.net&#x2F;tutorial<p>GitHub project\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;viewi&#x2F;viewi<p>I hope you will find something useful for yourself. Feel free to ask questions or leave feedback.<p>Thank you!',

        'The background of the question:<p>We are developing an open-source cloud-scalable vector database: Milvus[1]. In our new cloud architecture, we need to employ a messaging framework to serve as the central log sequence of the whole system. Ultimately, we will support well-known messaging solutions like Apache Kafka, Apache Pulsar, etc. Referring to Confluent&#x27;s article[2], Pulsar&#x27;s message consumption model is push-based, while Kafka&#x27;s is pull-based.<p>Our new cloud architecture is based on the actor model, which means all the worker nodes are working asynchronously, and the log sequence is the key to linking all the nodes. We think the push-based message consumption model and the actor model have more logical consistency. So we started with Apache Pulsar in our new implementation. We did have some concerns about Pulsar; for example,<p>- The project popularity<p>- The Go SDK is buggy<p>- The documentation is not as good as Kafka<p>We don&#x27;t think these points are showstoppers. However, some of our users have different thoughts. They are asking when we would support Kafka. Some of them even mentioned they won&#x27;t maintain Pulsar in their production environment.<p>So HN, please let me know your thoughts about this question. Should we give Kafka adoption a much higher priority since we just completed the new lease GA?<p>Reference:<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;milvus.io<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.confluent.io&#x2F;kafka-vs-pulsar&#x2F;',

        'GM to all,<p>We&#x27;ve been working on an opensource NPM package and tool https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nftoptions.app for creating options contracts on the Solana blockchain. The client is in nodejs https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;solana-options , with an onchain server written in Rust https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dbanda&#x2F;solana-nft-options<p>This package allows you to easily create options contracts for tokens on Solana, with specific expiry times and strike values on the blockchain in one line of code. Similarly, you can use it to mint tokens and create contracts on those tokens. This allows you to do things like mint an NFT for a piece of art and then sell a call contract to buy that NFT at a predefined price. Each contract is tied to an NFT too, so you can easily trade them as well.<p>The onchain program is currently available on Solana devnet and testnet. We hope to launch on mainnet soon and possibly drop the NFTs on platforms such as Solsea for easy exchange. Currently, the web app https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nftoptions.app only supports the Phantom wallet but we are looking to add more soon.<p>We are looking for feedback, contributors and testers. Issues can be filed on the GitHub. As always, any feedback is greatly appreciated.<p>Thanks y’all.',

        'Hi HN, we’re George, Oscar, and Dan, the founders of Nyckel (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nyckel.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nyckel.com</a>). Nyckel allows developers with no ML experience to train and deploy ML functions to classify images and text with very little training data. We let you go from a few labeled data points to a serverless machine-learned classifier in minutes.<p>The ML-as-a-Service space is dense, including some recent YC companies; so why did we create Nyckel? Our goal is to create a tool that is light, fast, fun, and accessible. Training only takes seconds, you only need 10s of annotations, we avoid ML-lingo and abstract away concepts that make developers feel like outsiders. Our pricing is transparent, signup is instant, and the platform is 100% self-serve.<p>Dan, an experienced engineer without any ML background, was building a social website that required manual curation of user-contributed content. He looked into automating this curation with ML and found offerings that required complicated setup and knowledge of ML concepts. He talked to his AI-researcher friend Oscar, and together they realized that the current solutions were unnecessarily complex and didn’t expose the right developer-friendly abstractions. We think there are many engineers like Dan who leave similar problems unsolved because of the effort required.<p>Using Nyckel, you upload a small (or large) amount of data, annotate a minimum of 2 examples per class, and have a trained model deployed in the cloud and callable via a REST API. All of this happens in seconds. As you use the model, you can continue to improve it by providing more data points as you encounter them. You can also explore and annotate your data in the UI.<p>The Nyckel AutoML engine is based on meta transfer learning. It’s “transfer” because it leverages a large set of pre-trained neural networks to represent your data, and it’s “meta” because we make informed decisions on which of the networks to try based on your particular problem. The design allows for a highly parallel execution where features are extracted and models trained by 100s of compute nodes in parallel requiring only 10s of seconds to train even with 1,000s of samples. We keep abreast of the latest deep-learning networks and add new networks to the system to improve existing and new models. Your trained model is immediately deployed on an elastic inference infrastructure.<p>Our customers are using us to do things like: tag and organize photos in a used-car marketplace; triage customer responses and support tickets for CRM (in multiple languages); determine fake vs real profile pictures to help with user verification; analyze blood sugar charts to suggest corrective actions; and build a barcode-less scanner for bulk foods.<p>Oscar has over 4k scientific citations of his AI research, as well as several industry applications behind him. Dan has designed multiple developer APIs throughout his career, most recently Square’s developer APIs. I led the Functions-as-a-Service team at Oracle Cloud and have extensive experience building large cloud systems. We think that ML, cloud, and API expertise is the right combination for this problem!<p>We have elastic pricing with an always-free tier. Beyond the free tier, we make money when you invoke your function to make a prediction.<p>We&#x27;re really happy we get to show this to you all. Thank you for reading it all! We’d love for you to check us out, and share your thoughts on Nyckel and your experiences in the ML tooling space in general.',

        'Hello people,<p>I was hoping for some opinions from some guys and girls who focus more on the backend of applications or full stack developers.<p>I am somewhat mixed up. I am a freelancer and I&#x27;ve developed several projects in Django (and also in Flask) and until now I have always used their template engines and I am happy so far. I combined it with vanilla JS, Jquery, sometimes with AlpineJs and now recently tried HTMX. To be honest, I cannot really complain since I managed to fashion all components to my and my customer&#x27;s liking without any major drawbacks. Although I have to be honest and say that I sometimes have pushed AlpineJs a bit too much, beyond its original purpose of just sprinkles.<p>The applications I build are mostly for SMEs to automate some of their tasks. For me to stay sane and to get the project done in time I strive for simplicity in terms of project architecture.<p>But everywhere I go I read about React or Vue and I absolutely understand that they have their purposes and are game-changing in some fields, no doubt. Now, I always wonder for myself, should I learn a front-end framework? Will I end up as a a jack of all trades and just create one messy application after another?<p>AlpineJs, HTMX, etc. are very much manageable to master in a foreseeable time but every time I try to sit down and start with Vue &#x2F; React I am faced with so many new variables (NPM, NodeJs, Typescript, Webpack, etc.) that I think I have to learn for at least half a year till I just understand what is going on. Specially as a freelancer I have to be able to fix things fast by myself if the shit hits the fan.<p>Now, does it make sense to learn Vue&#x2F;React as a solo programmer or just to stick with the small frameworks like AlpineJs&#x2F;HTMX? At what point do you consider a frontend framework essential and not just a feature?<p>Thanks in advance.',

      url: null,
      author: 'NWMatherson',
      points: 79,
      story_text:
        'Hi HN, I’m Nate, and here together with my co-founder Matt, we are the founders of ContainIQ (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.containiq.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.containiq.com&#x2F;</a>). ContainIQ is a complete K8s monitoring solution that is easy to set up and maintain and provides a comprehensive view of cluster health.<p>Over the last few years, we noticed a shift that more of our friends and other founders were using Kubernetes earlier on. (Whether or not they actually need it so early is not as clear, but that’s a point for another discussion.) From our past experience using open-source tooling and other platforms on the market, we knew that the existing tooling out there wasn’t built for this generation of companies building with Kubernetes.<p>Many early to middle-market tech companies don’t have the resources to manage and maintain a bunch of disparate monitoring tools, and most engineering teams don’t know how to use them. But when scaling, engineering teams do know that they need to monitor cluster health and core metrics, or else end users will suffer. Measuring HTTP response latency by URL path, in particular, is important for many companies, but can be time-consuming to install application packages for each individual microservice.<p>We decided to build a solution that was easy to set up and maintain. Our goal was to get users 95% of the way there almost instantly.<p>Today, our Kubernetes monitoring platform has four core features: \n(1) metrics: CPU and memory for pods&#x2F;nodes, view limits, capacity, and correlate to events, alert on changes; \n(2) events: K8s events dashboard, correlate to logs, alerts; \n(3) latency: monitor RPS, p95, and p99 latencies by microservices, including by URL path, alerts; and \n(4) logs: container level log storage and search.<p>Our latency feature set was built using a technology called eBPF. BPF, or the Berkeley Packet Filter, was developed from a need to filter network packets in order to minimize unnecessary packet copies from the kernel space to the user space. Since version 3.18, the Linux kernel provides extended BPF, or eBPF, which uses 64-bit registers and increases the number of registers from two to ten. We install the necessary kernel headers for users automatically.<p>With eBPF, we are monitoring from the kernel and OS level, and not at the application level. Our users can measure and monitor HTTP response latency across all of their microservices and URL paths, as long as their kernel version is supported. We are able to deliver this experience immediately by parsing the network packet from the socket directly. We then correlate the socket and sk_buff information to your Kubernetes pods to provide metrics like requests per second, p95, and p99 latency at the path and microservice level, without you having to instrument each microservice at the application level. For example with ContainIQ, you can track how long your node.js application is taking to respond to HTTP requests from your users, ultimately allowing you to see which parts of your web application are slowest and alerting you when users are experiencing slowdowns.<p>Users can correlate events to logs and metrics in one view. We knew how annoying it was to toggle between multiple tabs and then scroll endlessly through logs trying to match up timestamps. We fixed this. For example, a user can click from an event (ex a pod dying) to the logs at that point in time.<p>Users can set alerts across really all data points (ex. p95 latency, a K8s job failing, a pod eviction).<p>Installation is straightforward either using helm or with our YAML files.<p>Pricing is $20 per node &#x2F; month + $1 per GB of log data ingested. You can sign up on our website directly with the self-service flow. You can also book a demo if you would like to talk to us, but that isn’t required.

It is a world full of books and essays with interesting debates about key issues of software architecture. I&#x27;m now switching over to the world of NodeJS, but I can&#x27;t find the books or essays written to the same depth of detail. I&#x27;d like some pointers.<p>Just to take one issue. How should exceptions be managed? There was a long debate, in the world of the JVM, about whether exceptions should be handled as locally as possible to the point of the error, or whether it was simpler and cleaner, from the point of view of architecture, to let most exceptions bubble up to the top and handle all of them in one place. I personally favored handling errors locally, but I learned a lot by reading both sides of the debate.<p>I&#x27;m having trouble finding conversations like that, regarding NodeJS. Has there been a debate about best practice? Where can I find it?<p>Also, performance tuning. I have the impression that NodeJS is a bit more magical than the JVM, therefore discussions of performance tuning are considered besides the point in the world of NodeJS. Whereas the JVM offers a thousand configuration options, NodeJS seems to offer fewer. Is that correct? Where are good resources on this subject?',

      url: null,
      author: 'katspaugh',

      story_text:
        '<i>tl;dr</i>: I&#x27;ve created a live-coding environment with Canvas, Web Audio and setTimeout, here&#x27;s a demo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lambda.quest&#x2F;?gist=8eb332073b3b29ace1e2855dfdbad98f<p><i>About the project</i><p>Lambda Quest is a live-coding environment in your browser.\nWhen building Lambda Quest, I decided to go with native in-browser ES6 modules, without any compilation. It&#x27;s really refreshing to just write modern JS and not have to deal with Webpack.<p><i>Scheme + Emscripten</i><p>The core of the app is a Scheme interpreter called Gambit. It&#x27;s originally a C program that was compiled to JavaScript via Emscripten. It runs in a WebWorker and communicates with the main thread via postMessage.<p>To interact with Scheme, I&#x27;ve added the Monaco Editor. It&#x27;s the same open-source editor that powers the VSCode. Whenever you edit the Scheme code, and it&#x27;s syntactically correct, it will re-evaluate it live. So the results will be immediately visible on a Canvas.<p><i>Canvas</i><p>Speaking of Canvas, the rendering is fully asynchronous. Scheme puts Canvas method calls into an async queue. There&#x27;s a requestAnimationFrame loop running in the background that picks up any pushes to the queue. This makes animations possible through things like `(sleep 0.5)`.<p><i>Web Audio support</i><p>In addition to Canvas, I&#x27;ve implemented Web Audio support. So you can live-code music now!<p>Adding Web Audio wasn&#x27;t trivial because the Gambit interpreter is running in a Web Worker. So I have to send messages between the worker and the main JS thread to access any browser APIs.<p>Canvas was easy to implement, because it&#x27;s mostly procedural calls like `fillRect`, `stroke` etc. So I&#x27;m just sending commands from Lisp to JS.<p>Web Audio, on the other hand, is about creating trees of audio nodes. E.g. you create an Oscillator node and connect it to a Gain node, and finally connect the Gain node to a Destination node (output). Also you can set parameters on each node (e.g. the frequency of an oscillator).<p>This all means that Scheme needs a way to reference created nodes. However, I cannot send a node directly in a message from JS. Only atomic values like strings and numbers. To circumvent this limitation, I&#x27;ve created a registry of nodes in JS which can be accessed by id.<p>Scheme, when calling a Web Audio method, provides an id to store the result in. Also if it passes an id in one of the arguments, JavaScript looks it up in the registry and makes the call on the corresponding node.<p><i>setTimeout as a Scheme macro</i><p>Web Audio is not fun if you can&#x27;t program timed events for it. E.g. a sequence of notes, or a volume envelope that changes over time. So I had to make the Scheme code asynchronous.<p>Scheme, just like JavaScript, is single-threaded and &quot;synchronous&quot;. It needs a second process to tell it when to run a delayed call to achieve asynchronous behavior.<p>I&#x27;ve implemented a macro – https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;katspaugh&#x2F;lambda.quest&#x2F;blob&#x2F;main&#x2F;scheme&#x2F;w... – (which is btw my first macro ever) to put a Scheme callback in a JS `setTimeout`.<p>Macros, for me, is such a mind-blowing thing. It was amazing to code one purposefully, to achieve a practical goal.<p><i>GitHub API and OAuth</i><p>You can save your Scheme creations as gists on GitHub. I&#x27;ve implemented GitHub OAuth with a serverless worker on CloudFlare. The worker, of course, is also written in JS. All my projects are hosted on CloudFlare btw, it&#x27;s amazing.<p><i>Preact</i><p>Finally, I&#x27;ve used Preact and HTM for a React-like UI rendering. HTM is basically JS template strings that look like JSX and spit out DOM trees. Pretty neat, although a bit hard to edit.<p><i>Github</i><p>All the code is open-source (MIT) and can be read on GitHub: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;katspaugh&#x2F;lambda.quest<p>Pull requests and feedback are very welcome. Thanks for reading!',

        'I attended a top 5 law school and am currently a first-year in biglaw. Previously, I was a self-taught dev at small startups in LA. Nothing sophisticated, just standard MVC apps. I was mostly back-end (my front-end skills do include JavaScript, but not include CSS or ability to make things look pretty, etc) and I was able to maintain and deploy web apps all on my own. The last thing I did before law school was an accounting app I built from scratch and of which I was functionally the CTO. Technologies I used during my career: Python, NodeJS&#x2F;TypeScript, C#, React, Postgres.<p>I want to go back into tech. Assuming I want to be a software developer again:<p>1. What should I focus on learning to get a backend developer job that pays 180k+ in a major market (NY, LA, or SF)? Things I was starting to find interesting towards the end of the main part of my career include scripting to automate build processes, integration tests, and I guess what one could call crude architectural stuff that probably isn&#x27;t worth the name (Should I build the data layer using a &quot;repository manager&quot; class for each table and inheritance? At what point is it not over-engineering to bring in a cache?).<p>Trying to enumerate those examples brought home that I did not do anything remotely sophisticated during my career lol :( Maybe if I don&#x27;t know the answers to basic questions like that, those are the places to start.<p>Anyways, what are some of the next big things? One thing I think I might like is natural language processing, maybe I should start there.<p>2. Suppose I want to throw money at this (since I have some now)--is that even possible? For example, any recommendations for coding interview tutoring (which would be something to do near the end of the transition, after several months or more of self-learning)? I was pretty bad at dev interviews the last time I did them several years ago.<p>Please note:<p>Why I went into law in the first place and why I want to jump back into tech is not really something I want to hash out in this thread. Suffice to say, my interest in leaving is not because biglaw is awful or high-pressure or the people are toxic or anything like that, as some might think. I basically got very lucky: I am at one of the best firms in biglaw in terms of work-life balance and cordiality. It&#x27;s certainly the only one I know of that&#x27;s like this. My reasons for wanting to go back into tech have more to do with things that I miss about tech and business, such as the creative aspect of working on a product, the mission-orientation, etc. I know some of you will say &quot;reflect on why you stopped wanting to be a dev in the first place&quot;, but please suspend that argument for purposes of this thread.<p>Let&#x27;s assume for now that my timeline for leaving biglaw is probably about a year hence.<p>Thanks for all advice in advance.',

      story_text:
        'Historically, RS has nodes and slices. One node made of a given number of slices (varies by node type). Data is distributed over slices, and only the slice holding a block can access that block.<p>These days, you have RA3. RA3 has data slices and compute slices. The “data slice” I think is a group of one or more network attached SSDs, and each compute slice is an EC2 instance. Data is still distributed over slices, but I empirically see now that any slice on a node can access any block which is on that node - that’s definitely not how it used to be.<p>So I think what happens now is SSD is on the network, which is now a notional “data slice”, but there’s only one data slice per “node” (you don’t really have nodes any more - it’s more of a legacy billing concept), and you have a cloud of EC2 instances, but they’re each tied to one of the network attached SSD groups.<p>So, server-less - now we have to think about how data is being handled by RA3.<p>The actual data is stored in S3.<p>S3 lets you read at any offset in any given file (file as in byte stream in S3 - you know the deal), but S3 does not allow you to modify existing files. You can write en entire new file, but that’s it.<p>Since RS does have to support reasonably small writes, my guess is each column is broken up into many pretty small files in S3.<p>Redshift historically thought of distribution as you pick a column and all the rows with the same values go to the “same place”, which was the SSDs in a node (they were physically in the node), and in particular a given slice (since slices maintained their own files).<p>The concept of distribution now though has a whole new meaning because primary store is S3, which is just a bunch of files in “one place” (the S3 key space) and each compute slices can access S3 concurrently (I would guess one connection at a time per slice, that seems to be how it’s done).<p>Now, remember though for a join to be performed, the rows involved must end up on the same compute slice.<p>What could be happening now (and I think - I’ll need to re-read the white paper) this was something like how Snowflake works - you keep track of how many values are in the table, and when a query comes along, you assign the same value range to each compute slice - and it’s S3, so they just go ahead and access the files with those values in.<p>Changing node counts historically has been a huge cost because redistribution is required.<p>You can avoid redistribution with S3, because all data is stored in the same place - instead of redistributing the data, you redistribute which compute slices process which values.<p>That allows you to change the number of compute nodes easily and rapidly.<p>My initial take on this is that cluster resize may have finally properly been solved - although at a cost, since everything is now in S3 and I suspect that’s going to make write performance rather variable.<p>Far as I see it, that’s it. That’s the entire consequence of server-less. You still need to know completely and fully how to operate Redshift correctly, and almost no one does, because AWS publish no information on how to do this.<p>The idea of “not managing infrastructure” is to my mind a complete white elephant. This is not repeat NOT the issue. Knowing how to operate sorted column-store correctly is the issue.<p>You can introduce functionality to automate this (a primary selling point for Snowflake), but that functionality isn’t great - it’s much better than if you don’t know what you’re doing, but worse than if you do (but with Snowflake, if you do know what you’re doing, it doesn’t help, because there are no user-operated controls - it’s automation and only automation, for better or for worse!)<p>If you don’t know what you’re doing, you shouldn’t be using Redshift in the first place - probably you just don’t know it - every client I’ve worked for has imagined Redshift as a “big Postgres”.',

        'Hello HN<p>TL;DR: I probably created the fastest &quot;find all K simple paths&quot; algorithm for a weighted or unweighted, directed or undirected graph. How would I, as an outsider, publish the results? If I&#x27;m right, I&#x27;d like to benefit from this discovery to open doors to more interesting work&#x2F;careers. (I fear, in my 30s, I am at a huge disadvantage for not having any big co. or university to list on my resume)<p>Background:<p>I am outside of the tech &quot;scene&quot; and have no tech&#x2F;academia connections (self taught, no time spent in university). That being said, I&#x27;ve been programming and managing operations (working as the sole dev at small co.) for 10+ years. I recently quit my job to reevaluate my career path and for fun, started working on a city builder video game. The first big problem I had to solve was &quot;how can I efficiently simulate people&#x2F;cars utilizing ALL the fastest paths available to them?&quot; (in case you aren&#x27;t aware, Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm only returns one shortest path from start to destination).<p>Solution:<p>I created an algorithm that has a time complexity of around O((V+E)log V) and a space complexity of around O(n^2).<p>Now:<p>I tested the algorithm in my game world and watched my digital citizens utilize all the shortest paths available to them for various destinations around the map. For a heavy load test, I created a 100 x 100 grid (where each square is a node), and my code takes 1.75 times longer than Dijkstra&#x27;s. Since I can store the search tree I created, I can move tens of thousands of units around the map without any lag (using SFML vertex arrays for efficiently handling the screen draws).<p>I started researching other existing solutions and to my surprise, my solution is faster. Eppstein (1997) is the fastest solution I came across @ O(E + V log V + kV), where k can grow at some binomial coefficient (thus would be terribly inefficient with hundreds of nodes, let alone thousands, if many fastest paths existed, which is the reality of most cities if you walk).<p>Other notes (excuse my lack of traditional education here):<p>This does not prove P = NP (phew! I&#x27;m safe.). While the number of shortest paths can grow at some binomial coefficient, the classification of all possible paths does not. To explain by example: Going from node (A) to node (G) could possibly use nodes (B, C, D, E, F) along the way. So A--&gt;G is a classification. When we add a new node (H) to (G), that (A) can only get to via (G), the A--&gt;G classification is not changed. On the other hand, if every node connected to every other node, the amount of classifications would increase at an exponential rate (and devolve into all NP-Complete problems), and the possible amount of k paths (not necessarily shortest) would grow super-binomial coefficient-ly.',

      story_text:
        'Hey HN! Vlad here with Sergey, Ildar, and Kirill. We are building Jitsu, an open-source Segment alternative (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jitsucom&#x2F;jitsu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jitsucom&#x2F;jitsu</a>, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jitsu.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jitsu.com&#x2F;</a>). We help companies collect events from their apps, websites, and APIs and send them to databases.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing data engineering for more than ten years (half of that time, I didn&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s called &quot;data engineering”). Before Jitsu, I was a co-founder and CTO of GetIntent, an ad-tech startup. Although it was ad-tech (I&#x27;m sorry for that!), we also built a quite fascinating technology platform. We processed up to 1 million events per second at peak, and all those events needed to be stored somewhere.<p>We churned through a few data warehouse platforms along the way. In 2013, we started with Hadoop&#x27;s HDFS and a bunch of map-reduce jobs on top of it. Then, when we decided to allow our customers to run ad-hoc reports, we switched to BigQuery. BigQuery was great, but expensive—especially with some customers obsessively clicking the refresh button. Finally, in 2017 we migrated to self-hosted ClickHouse which in my opinion is still the best analytics database in the world.<p>All that time, we spent a fair amount of effort to get data to the database. When you&#x27;re dealing with millions of events per minute, running an INSERT statement per event won&#x27;t work. What if the DB is down for maintenance? How can you be sure that all 50+ edge nodes are aware of recent DB schema changes? Also, did you know streaming data to BigQuery is costly while batching data is free?<p>We tried different approaches: first, we would write local log files, sync them to HDFS, and load data to BQ (or ClickHouse) with map-reduce jobs. To improve data freshness, we ditched HDFS and started to send data in batches to the DB directly from edge servers. We experimented with Kafka, but it felt too complex for that task at the time.<p>I always dreamed about a straightforward service, to which I&#x27;d throw JSON objects, and it would take care of the rest: queueing, retrying, updating database schema, etc.<p>Then I discovered Segment. I liked it at first. It seemed very developer-friendly with a nice API and excellent documentation. But the pricing model and data delays (the event gets to DB in 12 hours after it has been sent to Segment) killed the whole idea. And it was not open-sourced. In my opinion, being open-source and self-hostable is a must for such a fundamental part of the architecture as data collection.<p>I left GetIntent and got accepted to YC with a different idea for the Summer 2020 batch. The idea was to build a churn prevention and BI tool for online retailers. It didn&#x27;t take off, but in the process we made a component to collect customer&#x27;s app events and put it to DB. We tried to hack a solution on top of the ELK stack, but I was frustrated with ElasticSearch’s lack of SQL support.  Here I was back to square one: there&#x27;s no good open-source event collection service yet, and we needed to build one, once again.<p>So we decided to focus solely on that problem. We ditched all the previous code, which was in Java, rewrote the data collection server in Go and hacked together what we called EventNative [1]. It was received very well, and we started to get users.<p>Over the last 11 months, we&#x27;ve been busy building the UI, adding Connectors (to pull data from external APIs), polishing data warehouse support, adding javascript support to transform incoming data, and implementing dozens of other features.<p>Now we&#x27;re launching Jitsu, an open-source Segment alternative. With Jitsu, we make it easy to collect data and send it to databases (we support all major players: ClickHouse, Redshift, Snowflake, BigQuery and Postgres). We’re deployed in production, including into a large gaming publisher, eSignature service, and many other great companies.  We&#x27;re going for an open-core model. So far we don&#x27;t have paid features, but soon we&#x27;ll have some, presumably around things like authorization and data masking. Also we run Jitsu.Cloud[2] which you can buy if you don’t want to self-host<p>Give it a spin: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jitsucom&#x2F;jitsu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jitsucom&#x2F;jitsu</a>.<p>Thank you for reading this story - I hope it was interesting. I would love to read your feedback on Jitsu and answer questions!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24120325" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24120325</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.jitsu.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.jitsu.com</a>',

        '7GUIs: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;eugenkiss&#x2F;7guis<p>My implementation: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i5ik.github.io&#x2F;_____&#x2F;7guis&#x2F;<p>I built this after seeing Brad Woods&#x27; work on Show HN.<p>I wanted to do it because it was different to the other GUI benchmarks I had seen before such as RealWorld and Todo MVC.<p>I liked how the original author wrote the description of the tasks and the challenges they were supposed to try to address and I appreciated that design and usability thinking, as well as the chance to flesh out and test a framework for how it could handle this. I also knew that GUI programming was one of my weaknesses so I wanted to push myself to learn more.<p>The most challenging was Cells, and I procrastinated for a bit before getting into it. But actually the scripting side of that challenge was not as hard as just getting the markup right.<p>I was also building a web components framework at the same time and using these challenges to develop and test the features of that framework. The most challenging thing there was figuring out how to get a good load time without displaying partially loaded GUI components. Basically this man keeping track of a components subcomponent dependencies and and marking the ancestor component as loaded only when all it&#x27;s dependents and it&#x27;s uncontent was loaded.<p>In the case of cells which calls for 99 rows and 26 columns it ended up producing around 10,000 nodes which took quite a while to render in the browser and in my framework. It was a good chance to try to push the performance of that framework as far as it could go. A lot of time was spent in the performance tab of devtools.<p>Something else that was important was getting a good load time while maintaining responsiveness on the main thread render across a range of devices.<p>This was challenging because providing that responsiveness for lower end devices unavoidably sacrificed load time for higher spec devices that may not have had any lack of responsiveness at all. But I decided that I wanted responsiveness to be the priority and then to maximize the achievable load time given that constraint.<p>I achieved this by splitting up the work of the big render using a function to insert asynchronous sleeps between bundles of work.<p>The sleeps allowed the main thread to maintain some low frame rate of responsiveness while it completed the off screen rendering of the large component, without taking too long.<p>The current version of the demo uses a small Cells component just to save time. This will be my only comment on this thread, if you want more info you can check out the framework repository: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;i5ik&#x2F;_____',

        'After seeing Ashley&#x27;s viral tweet yesterday claiming she was suspended and fired in retaliation, I read through her entire Twitter feed and found she is misrepresenting what occurred and libeling Apple.<p>I am not an Apple employee, nor an Apple fanboy.<p>I stand strongly with Frances Haugen, Ifeoma Ozoma, Timnit Gebru, Cher Scarlett, and other whistleblowers against the evil corporate tech giants.<p>Whatever may have actually happened to Ashley is destroyed entirely by her lies. I believe she is only trying to jumpstart her law career and make money.<p>Ashley posted a screenshot of this email from July 27, 2021, to prove that she did not request paid leave. In it, it shows she asks for a paid exit through the remainder of her law education, at which time she planned to leave Apple (Dec 31, 2022), or alternatively, to be placed in a temporary role within the company, without having to actually apply for the role. In return, they suggested she apply for Medical Leave, which would continue to pay her full salary while mitigating the toxic work environment (physically and emotionally, by her own account).<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;E-YWLeEUYAEgHWb?format=jpg&amp;name=large<p>She declined Medical Leave and asked instead for Paid Administrative Leave and they accommodated that request, as she is quoted in this article, \n&quot;I asked them to mitigate the hostile work environment while they investigate, and they initially offered me EAP therapy and medical leave. I told them that made no sense, and said they should talk to my leadership and set up oversight and boundaries. I added that if there was no other option they could give me paid administrative leave.&quot; (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;8&#x2F;4&#x2F;22610112&#x2F;apple-female-engineering-manager-leave-sexism-work-environment)<p>After she went on leave, and immediately claimed it was forced on her, she tweeted the correspondence from HR expressing that if she did not want to be on leave, she was free to return at any time.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pbs.twimg.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;E-mP2FkVkAU29LE?format=jpg&amp;name=large<p>For her claim of being fired in retaliation, this article discusses an unreleased product.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theverge.com&#x2F;22648265&#x2F;apple-employee-privacy-icloud-id<p>The video in the article is her, which she further cross-posted to her Twitter account, and from reading about the application, could only have come from her.<p>I feel sorry for her, given the harassment she may have endured over the prior 6 years, but I don&#x27;t understand why she felt the need to lie about what has happened in the past few months, as it completely destroys her credibility, and likely puts her in a situation where Apple can sue her for defamation (I&#x27;m not a lawyer, but this seems obvious).<p>- Not a troll, just works on nodejs',

        'Hi all, Hi, dear 2021 folks.<p>You know what?\nI actually find that 2021 front-end development has a problem of productivity.<p>A. Big. F*<i>ing. Sh*ty. Problem of productivity.<p>Read below, my dudes.<p>Front-end development is better than back-end to making deadlines fly away like gulls. ;-)\n-&gt; Front-end choose their techs by thinking about speeds. But not the good ones. i. Speed of frontend execution at client-side. ii. Speed of transfer of the frontend from the server to the client. iii. Even speed of execution of the frontend... backside (NextJS).\n-&gt; BUT F*</i> MY GUYS. YOU KNOW THE F*<i>ING WHAT? Nowadays, Internet taken as a whole is so fast, servers are so fast, clients are so fast, all is so fast that looking for fast front-end fetching queries to the server and&#x2F;or for execution gains of the frontend is shallow, overengineering, USELESS. So why are you thinking about those speeds again and again and again. You would have better to throw your watermelon to the trash.<p>What would be welcome and ACTUALLY USEFUL?\nI answer you in two words, 7 letters ;-).\nFAST. DEV.\nFAST DEVELOPMENT, fucking JESUS.\n(Well the whole list would be: fast dev + super UX-design).\nThe other speeds? Don&#x27;t care. Blablabla. Don&#x27;t. F*</i>ing. Care.<p>Trust me. Trust the speed of dev. It&#x27;s the FUTURE.<p>1. What would be very useful: a kind of WYSIWYG to create responsive and UX-designed GUI for webapps and websites. You would be able to bind your WYSIWYG widgets to some logic (NodeJS Nest.JS or PHP Laravel) and both frontend and logic would be bound to some model (Strapi). You would choose the good techs in order to maximize speed of development. Should this WYSIWYG tech be open-source, proprietary, self-hosted, cloud-hosted, should it output dependent webapp&#x2F;websites or actual, i.e. self-sufficiently executing webapp&#x2F;websites, should this WYSIWYG be subject to versioning, all of these questions = I have my own opinion but yeah;<p>2. What would be useful if this tech doesn&#x27;t yet exist in 2021: a fast dev frontend framework (or more exactly I should rather say: a fast dev frontend widgets&amp;design library).<p>NOW MY GUYS. Read again bellow AND TRY IT.<p>1. Open HackerNews. Or Google. Type &quot;low code frontend&quot;, &quot;low-code frontend&quot;, &quot;lowcode front-end&quot; and whatever the syntax you want. What you will find are only 2 or 3 solutions. All except one cost the ass and are proprietary (not even open-source wtf). The last one, AppSmith, is for internal projects only (don&#x27;t allow us to do responsive designs&#x2F;widgets).<p>2. Open HackerNews....... Google.... Type &quot;frontend&quot; and read 10 first pages like I did. You will mostly find Next.JS + Ant design or Svelte. But are they really fast dev? Nooope my dude, nope nope nope, they just have a learning curve faster than React ;-).<p>You guys, I actually find that 2021 front-end development has a problem of productivity.<p>A. Big. F*<i>ing. Sh*ty. Problem of productivity.</i>',

The one thing it doesn&#x27;t do - automated testing.<p>Without testing, we are seeing silly issues caused by forgetting simple things like re-enabling nodes, accidentally deploying things that are broken, etc. \nWe would like to create a CI pipeline in the future, but without this testing piece of the puzzle, I don&#x27;t think it is a possibility.<p>Node-Red does have a test option (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;node-red&#x2F;node-red-node-test-helper), but it is not very robust, and it&#x27;s currently in beta. It is very frustrating to develop tests using this package add-on. The tests are also subject to breaking very easily if the id of a node that you are testing ever changes (say someone deleted and replaced the node with the same node).<p>Are there any other low code solutions that we can use to manage these internal processes that have robust testing for developing a CI pipeline?',

I tried in the past to learn Vue from some Udemy course and a book but I got bored with the pace of the resource. It was building something very simple and focused too much on Nodejs on Backend and React on Frontend.<p>What would you suggest? What worked for you?',

        'Hi HN.<p>Here is an idea for a cryptocurrency I have been toying with for a few days:\nIt can use any consensus algorithm that doesn’t require huge amount of energy as the number of user grows (so no Proof of Work).\nWhen a new block is added, part of the coins that get generated are sent to a few fixed wallets.\nThese wallets would be well known by all the nodes (so nodes can all validate that these are the right addresses) and would belong to a select few non-profit organizations that actively work in environmental restoration&#x2F;protection (e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edenprojects.org&#x2F; or https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theoceancleanup.com&#x2F;), carbon capture (e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;climeworks.com&#x2F;) and other related fields (e.g. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.catf.us&#x2F;), I haven&#x27;t really thought of which organization to give to, this list is just an example.\nEach non-profit would need to publicly declare that they own these wallets to ensure that the coins aren&#x27;t being taken by a third party.\nThe list of organizations&#x2F;wallets could change over time, and would be selected by the community, probably with a formal process where anybody can create a proposal, then people can vote on them.<p>Here are a few questions that I have:\n- Are there any similar project already existing? I&#x27;d be happy to contribute to an already established project.\n- What are the problems you can foresee with this idea?\n- In particular, what are potential security issues here, how can I make sure no attacker can add custom addresses to this list?\n- Do you have any improvements to this?\n- Any pointer to an appropriate blockchain tech to build this on? I assume it would take far longer to implement it from scratch.',

      url: null,
      author: 'phowson83',

      story_text:
        'Hi HN, we’re Iona Mind. We provide app-based mental health support, with a focus on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT).<p>Mental healthcare is difficult for many people to access, whether because of cost, stigma or waiting times. According to a recent pre-covid study in England [1] 18% of people are experiencing a mental health issue, yet only 5% actually access help through an employer’s assistance plan (if one even exists) [2] . The majority suffer in silence. In addition to the human cost, there are significant economic costs. In the U.S., mental health issues cost employers thousands of dollars per employee per year in medical costs and lost productivity [3].<p>At our previous company, we lost a colleague to suicide. Since then we’ve been on a mission to bring evidence-based mental healthcare to as many people as possible. We were surprised to find that Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is backed by over 30 years of research, and over 250 meta-analyses [4], yet remains difficult for people to access. CBT has been shown to be effective for a wide range of mental health conditions, even when administered digitally [5] or in books (so called bibliotherapy) [6]. While we do not believe that self or app administered CBT can replace the human touch, it does provide a convenient, affordable, always accessible and stigma-free way for many users to access support, when they may not have been able or ready to seek it in person. In the UK, the NHS presents a progressive “stepped model” of mental healthcare, depending upon severity from step 1 to step 4. We see apps playing a part in step 1, step 1a and possibly step 2 of this model [7].<p>While there are a number of CBT apps available, we wanted to base ours around Low-Intensity Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, a relatively new variant which has been used extensively in England to treat people with mild to moderate conditions at scale. In low-intensity CBT, the patient more or less treats themselves by doing exercises, and the therapist supports the process. This approach to CBT is especially suited to delivery through a digital form. Our clinical director, Professor Paul Farrand, was the architect of using Low-Intensity Cognitive Behavioural therapy at scale in the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), and the editor of one of the first international textbooks on the subject [8].<p>Our app presents the user with a chatbot which guides them through CBT techniques and exercises. We went for a chat-style UI to make the software more engaging—it’s a challenge to make an app of this kind be more than just a “content board”. Our chatbot engine is graph-based. At some nodes in the graph, classifiers applied to the user’s free text entry determine the path through this graph, along with the user’s state and past inputs. We want the paths within the app to be predictable and ensure that the chatbot doesn’t do anything unexpected. We’d seen more freeform generative seq2seq style chatbots produce potentially dangerous output at times in other apps and wanted to avoid this. Also, CBT has been shown to often work better when “therapist drift” is minimized—this is where the therapist drifts away from the prescribed structure of the exercises in CBT [9]. A graph-based conversation is a good way to keep things on track.<p>We offer the app as an employee wellness benefit to organizations. Since only 5% of employees tend to use the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) at their employer, the app offers a way to support the “missing middle” for whom mindfulness&#x2F;meditation apps are not sufficient, but who aren’t ready to access their employer’s EAP. We offer use of the app completely anonymously if the user wishes. It’s in the Apple App Store at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;iona-anxiety-mood-support&#x2F;id1491343580" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;iona-anxiety-mood-support&#x2F;id14913...</a> and Google Play at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.iona.mental.health" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.iona.menta...</a>.<p>We’d be really interested to hear from the community about any ideas or experiences you&#x27;ve had when it comes to delivering mental health support digitally.

I am looking for one of reasonably modern &quot;batteries included&quot; web stacks which strike balance between productivity (reasonably fast to prototype, not leading to unmaintainable magic code) and performance (not very resource hungry, reasonably good at vertical scaling, which I suppose rules out many python&#x2F;ruby based stacks).<p>My preferences:\n    * Good component libraries.<p><pre><code>    * reasonably good on front end performance.\n\n    * Preferably in typed language.\n\n    * On back-end side, easy libraries or built in facilities for common tasks such as authentication.\n</code></pre>\nI have looked at a few. On front end, svelte seems very good in concept, but I&#x27;m afraid ecosystem is small and still developing. Angular is not apparently preferred much. On backend, I have read about some Java (Play, spring) and nodejs based frameworks. But before diving into one, I&#x27;d like to ask a few experienced people here, as the shortcomings don&#x27;t become apparent until you&#x27;ve worked in it.',

I have some ideas on what ISPs could be doing better in 2021, but I’m seeking more input from the HN community.<p>A couple of caveats:<p>- Better customer service is a given. We know ISP customer service sucks, and we’re working on that. (Feel free to share horror stories, though :)<p>- Speed, price, and reliability are a given. These are basically our number one priorities already.<p>Here are a couple things I’ve already been thinking about. Feel free to expand on them, disagree with them, or share something completely different!<p>- What does a more hackable ISP look like? There are obvious things like providing an API to change your Wifi SSID&#x2F;password, monitor throughput, etc. What else could be made hackable?<p>- What does a more private ISP look like? A solid privacy policy guaranteeing that traffic isn’t spied on and data isn’t sold would be a good start, but are there more tangible ways to increase privacy? What if we ran Tor nodes on our edge so you could connect to one without traversing the internet? What else could be done?<p>- What does a more automated ISP look like? What techniques can be used to achieve a massive scale?<p>So HN: what do you want your ISP to do better?',

        'We run big integration tests that stand up multiple services (Postgres, etc.) plus our own code in a Kubernetes cluster, then run lots of tests on them. Some of tests are stress tests that put a bunch of load on them, some are benchmarks, and some are pure integration tests.<p>We currently use Argo Workflows (to express the pipelines) plus Argo Events (to start automatic tests on GitHub webhooks), which allows us control over the Kubernetes aspect, but it is a mess of YAML, and it requires us to first put the workflows into Kubernetes as &quot;workflow templates&quot; that are then executed to generate the running &quot;workflows&quot;. Argo is also quite flaky and buggy. I&#x27;ve been thinking of using Jsonnet to make this less of a mess, but that doesn&#x27;t solve all the complaints.<p>We also use CircleCI for some stuff, but it&#x27;s much too limited; no support for running multiple nodes, for example. We&#x27;ve decided to just use it for normal building, unit tests, and linting.',

But surely the tooling is better than what I’m finding in my Google searches. Anybody have a killer setup for something like this?<p>Online is ok. One-time software purchase is ok. A working tool-chain of multiple tools is ok, as long as it results in a more real-time interaction with the existing real model of the db.<p>Any recommendations?',

      url: null,
      author: 'wdanilo',
      points: 205,
      story_text:
        'Hi HN, We are Wojciech and Sylwia, the co-founders of Enso (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;enso.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;enso.org</a>). On the tech side, Enso is a visual and textual programming language (you can switch from graph to code and back). On the business side, it&#x27;s a workflow builder that makes it easy for analysts without a programming background to automate data-driven processes simply by connecting visual components together. Our GUI is like an IDE, but with a graph editor alongside the code. Currently, we’re focused on data analysis—data preparation, blending, and analytics (both in-memory and SQL). You can see a video of how it works here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;fQvWMoOjmQk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;fQvWMoOjmQk</a>.<p>We used to be called Luna and were lucky to have a few big threads on HN over the years [1][2][3][4][5]. Eventually we went into heads-down mode to make a production version based on customer and user feedback. Since then, we&#x27;ve drastically improved the product. It is still rough around the edges, but works much better now. We have also made a few tutorials (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UC4oMK7cL1ElfNR_OhS-YQAw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;channel&#x2F;UC4oMK7cL1ElfNR_OhS-YQAw</a>), and\ndocs (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;enso.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;syntax" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;enso.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;syntax</a>). We&#x27;ve added many new libraries, so you can do many more things with it now. Oh, and we changed the name to Enso and got accepted to YC! :)<p>The problem we address is that data analysts still waste up to half of their time on repetitive manual work that can be automated [6]. To give one example, a company we&#x27;re working with hires business users who use Excel to define data quality rules. These get manually translated to SQL, then manually translated to Python. This is not only error prone, it’s so slow that it takes them 90 days to introduce a single new rule. There’s 60 days’ worth of overhead in this process—it’s insane!<p>Years ago I (Wojciech) led the in-house development of visual effects (VFX) tools at a motion picture studio. We made tools like cloud renderers and smoke simulation engines. The artists using these tools did not have any programming background, yet they were designing complex algorithms for forces between particles, light subsurface scattering, things like that. Earlier generations of these tools had hundreds of config options, buttons, etc., for masses of different use cases, but this approach got way too complex and people eventually realized that it falls short when you need to do anything that the vendor did not think of. Nowadays they use node-based software (like the Houdini FX) which lets users draw algorithms as a sequence of data processing steps (these steps are often referred to as “nodes”). Later, when I was working in other industries and encountered the same rats’ nests of complex GUIs for solving data processing problems, I realized that the data analytics&#x2F;science space was in need of the same breakthrough that we had already gone through in the VFX space.<p>Most visual programming languages &#x2F; workflow-builders do not scale well because they don&#x27;t let users express abstractions. Try to build a complex pipeline and you&#x27;ll end with an unreadable spaghetti of connections—it&#x27;s like coding a web app in assembler. Enso is different because we allow you to build abstractions to manage the complexity. As a result, you never have more than 10-20 nodes on the stage in Enso (nodes are hierarchical). You can create custom data types, custom components (functions), catch errors, etc. All this works because under the hood, Enso is a real programming language. However, naive implementations of such systems are super slow. Each component may be built of hundreds, sometimes thousands of lower-level ones. The real trick is making these hierarchical components run fast. For that you need a dedicated compiler and a runtime system, and this is a hard technical space. Our system involves a dedicated JIT compiler based on GraalVM. For details, see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;enso.org&#x2F;language#compiler" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;enso.org&#x2F;language#compiler</a>. In case this is interesting for you, here is our podcast about how the compiler works under the hood: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=BibjcUjdkO4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=BibjcUjdkO4</a>.<p>Enso is interactive, meaning that we recompute the relevant parts of graphs as parameters change, which shortens feedback loops dramatically. Like a lot of people on HN, we were inspired by Bret Victor&#x27;s classic talk on instant feedback: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=8QiPFmIMxFc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=8QiPFmIMxFc</a>.  We’ve also put a lot of effort into extensibility. You can add Java, JavaScript, R, and Python (soon also Ruby, Scala, Kotlin, Rust, and C) directly into Enso nodes without the need to write any wrappers and with a close-to-zero performance overhead.<p>Enso is open source. Our compiler code is at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;enso-org&#x2F;enso" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;enso-org&#x2F;enso</a> and our GUI code at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;enso-org&#x2F;ide" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;enso-org&#x2F;ide</a>. Our business model is based on selling domain specific libraries, on-premise installations with enhanced user permission management, and coming soon, a hosted solution called Enso Cloud, which will be our only non-open-source codebase. Since this is Hacker News, I should add that all our alpha releases collect anonymous usage statistics which we use to improve Enso and prepare it for a stable release. Full details about that are always in our release notes (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;enso-org&#x2F;ide&#x2F;releases&#x2F;latest" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;enso-org&#x2F;ide&#x2F;releases&#x2F;latest</a>).<p>Dear HN friends, we are super excited to show Enso to you. Please, share with us your thoughts, experiences, ideas and feedback. It is insanely important to us, as our dream is to make Enso the most useful data processing platform in your toolbox! Also, in case you’d like to build your projects on top of Enso, we would love to help you do it – describe what you have in mind here, and we will reach out to you: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;airtable.com&#x2F;shrsnx2mJuRn0MxIS" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;airtable.com&#x2F;shrsnx2mJuRn0MxIS</a> :)<p>=== Links ===<p>[1] <i>Luna: Visual and textual functional programming language</i> - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11144828" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11144828</a> - Feb 2016 (100 comments)<p>[2] <i>Luna – Visual and textual functional programming language</i> - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14612680" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14612680</a> - June 2017 (310 comments)<p>[3] <i>Luna 1.0 Beta is out</i> - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16163769" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=16163769</a> - Jan 2018 (167 comments)<p>[4] <i>Luna Studio – Visual and textual functional programming language</i> - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17704989" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17704989</a> - Aug 2018 (64 comments)<p>[5] <i>Luna – A WYSIWYG language for data processing</i> - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20182090" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=20182090</a> - June 2019 (86 comments)<p>[6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alteryx.com&#x2F;e-book&#x2F;idc-study-the-state-of-self-service-data-preparation-and-analysis-using-spreadsheets" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.alteryx.com&#x2F;e-book&#x2F;idc-study-the-state-of-self-s...</a>',

GBytes??)<p>Thinking about the best way to manage the connections in every node I firstly came up with two possible options:<p>Op. 1) Open and close a connection every time we have to send data to a node. Issue: potential overload due to the continuous open&#x2F;close.\nOp. 2) Maintain some connection manager to operate these connections for us. Issue: additional complexity.<p>I would love hearing your experiences and opinions on this topic.',

I find out that the systemic approach can help with that. I might be wrong but I believe that this system overview might be relevant to prevent failure, enhance synergies, and help to lower the carbon impact of a company.<p>Graphs with nodes, interconnected by relations similar to a mindmap are well known to represent systems. This graphic representation is powerful as a communication medium and like I said could be useful to analyze your business and stay ahead.<p>I know tools to build mindmaps but no one is focused on business and startup specificities.

Currently this works with Node&#x27;s child_process spawning a process and collecting std out.<p>I want to remove the Node dependency entirely by running the Bash script directly. I would just shuttle query parameters from the URL into the script as arguments. I think (hope) there is a way to do this like SQL parameterized queries, where arbitrary input can&#x27;t escape from its placeholder and execute other commands.<p>Is there an existing HTTP server that supports this? What pitfalls would I run into? Is the whole idea stupid and I should just keep using Node?',

        'How it work?<p>Although WebRTC is a very fast and cheap technology, opening too many connections causes problems with the scalability and performance of the application. Decentralized applications often use the Mesh topology, so the use of WebRTC is a tough choice for a project that might have a lot of users. Therefore, nodes have to meet some conditions before they are connected to each other.<p>A small example to explain:<p>If you type &quot;foxql&quot; in the search box and search, the query packet is sent to the signal server first. The signal server broadcasts this to all users. Then all users search for the term &quot;foxql&quot; in their databases during the predetermined timeout. Webrtc connection is initiated with users who successfully respond within the given time. In this way, a connection with a certain number of users is always initiated no matter how many users there are.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;foxql',

        'Basically I&#x27;m just wondering if grass is greener on the other side.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I really like FE development and I&#x27;ve been successful in creating a nice career out of it for myself, becoming specialist in certain areas - I&#x27;m working on what is now I guess considered &quot;modern&quot; web apps. That means more or less creating React SPAs and figuring out the whole tech stack (webpack etc).<p>I do have experience with BE as well but last time I did any professional work was 4 years ago, I used to be Ruby on Rails developer and I liked that as well. I can also do some NodeJS development and work with databases. So I think I have general idea of both sides, just not very up-to-date on current backend tech.<p>I am asking because I seem to notice micro-trend where some people are actually advocating for moving back to monolith architecture and manage user state, including FE all at one place (server), Phoenix&#x27;s LiveView comes to mind. I have not tried these new web-socket approaches yet. I was thinking maybe having a look at that and if the trend actually becomes norm, I&#x27;d like to have the skill set.<p>I know BE has become more complex as well with introduction of Kubernetes and other technologies (or more simple? IDK).<p>What is your take on this?',

        'Hello HN, \nI last build web applications almost a decade or more back and am mostly in a PM role for now. About a decade back, we were building web applications with JQuery and Javascript. The frameworks involved a lot of manual work and the separation of business rules and data was hard to maintain. But the plus point was that every line of code that went into the system was known to me.<p>However, exploring the current web application development landscape seems a lot more scary now. Nodejs with 100&#x27;s of dependencies for each basic task and tools like yarn, gulp, bower confuse me more today.<p>My business requirements are mostly to build a transactional crud system with a moderately complex workflow rules (i.e data passes to various stakeholders who approve&#x2F;reject&#x2F;modify data).<p>I am exploring a the right development methodology for this task. My skillset is just HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python.',

Like a feed layer on top your web page.\nNew users will find your project by hopping from page to the next.\nI hope to create a positive sum game here.<p>3 weeks ago I posted a here and got positive feedback. So, thank you.\nI took it from demo to product spending on average 2 hours a day.<p>The backend is written in nodejs + postgres hosted on hetzner.\nI&#x27;m running it on the cheapest tier ~3Euro.<p>Most of the heavy lifting is done by postgres + graphile&#x2F;worker [https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;graphile&#x2F;worker].\nImages are cached on cloudflare and the server just sends ~400 btyes of json telling the browser what to fetch.

        'Hello HN!<p>I&#x27;m Jeff Costa, product manager at Akamai for EdgeKV (and a few other things). As a CDN running hundreds of thousands of servers in 135 countries, we know something about caching, networks, and distributed computing. After we launched EdgeWorkers, our serverless compute product, we quickly realized that <i>where</i> data was located was critical. If you run JavaScript functions at the edge, but have to reach back to a cloud database or a single datacenter, the round-trip latency could negate the performance benefit. EdgeKV was built to solve that problem.<p>We decided to start with a key-value store layered into the CDN model. The focus was making database reads as fast as cached object reads, while writing data quickly. We built a new cache layer for EdgeKV to ensure that when EdgeWorker code needs data (ex: to make a decision inside a function), it pulls that data from the adjacent data cache in ms. For writes, we landed on an eventual consistency model as it provides reliability via redundancy. When a write is made, we send it to multiple nodes in our persistent backend, then update any copies of it that exist on edge servers - without impacting read performance. This means that when you write a value, it may return stale data for a short period of time when you attempt to read it - but will eventually return the latest value in subsequent reads. The period of time between write and read convergence is called the &quot;inconsistency window,&quot; and our goal is complete global data writes within 10 seconds. Ten seconds.<p>Think about what apps and data can benefit from living closer to your customers. Beta signup form, GitHub, and docs listed below. EKV is beta, so expect a few warts. We&#x27;re excited to hear your questions and feedback on what we&#x27;ve built, so please reach out or leave a comment below. Thanks for reading!<p>Jeff \n@cosjef<p>[0] Beta signup: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;3qBVesV\n[1] EKV User Guide: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;2OKVLvt\n[2] GitHub repo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;3cqblVh',

        'I have bought M1 MacBook Air 13&quot; 16GB In January 2021. Here are my thoughts on this machine so far.<p>Speed.\nAww yeah, it is lightning fast! \nMy daily setup: Postgres, VScode (+48 plugins), Sublime Text, Slack, Discord, Spotify, Thunderbird, Telegram, Chrome, Firefox, iTerm, Figma, Alfred. All simultaneously.\nNot a single freeze so far. Each app opens instantly.<p>Apps.\nAs you know, there is a chip incompatibility issue. And there is something called Rosetta to fix it. \nSo I expected some problems with apps.\nBut in reality, I did not have to care about this. There&#x27;s no difference between M1 and Intel to me.<p>What went wrong.\nMy biggest fear was not being able to launch my development environment. \nWhen I typed brew install python@3.7 in the terminal I got this error: &quot;The x86_64 architecture is required for this software.&quot;.\nIt instantly made me pale because this means I will have to carry 2 laptops to be able to code my product \nThe problem was solved quickly by upgrading the project to a newer version of Python. Thank goodness our dependencies did not mess up because of the update.\nThe next problem was nodejs v11 which was needed to launch the product locally. yarn start took ~2 hours (HOURS!) to launch. Each update took ~5 minutes to compile. The development process was awful. I got pale again \nThe problem was solved by moving to a newer nodejs version. Again, the dependencies did not break up. But the things could easily mess up because nodejs dependencies are complicated as hell.\nNow it compiles instantly, yarn build takes 30 sec.<p>Keyboard.\nIt is much better than the previous generations have. Apple has fixed it.\nIt is not as brilliant as the old one from my MacBook Pro 2012, but still fine.<p>Why Air, not Pro.\nAFAIK, the Pro version has these differences: better battery, better mic + sound, more ports (+2). I did not find these features significant enough to pay extra. And I also dislike Touch Bar.',

        'In December of 2020, we got very nervous.\nLet&#x27;s go a little back in time. We ran our very first infrastructure on a small German data center.<p>They offered a really nice UI, were GDPR compliant, and also much cheaper than the big international competitors in comparison.<p>What we were not aware of, was that they provided a maximum of only 10 servers.<p>This meant that there was no way they could scale with us long term, as our team is located in different countries and utilize hundreds of nodes. It would have not even sufficed for our launch alone.<p>Our dream requirements were:\ninitially 80+ servers in one German datacenter\neach server having &gt;50GB RAM and &gt;10 vCPUs\n&gt;20% automatable growth per month\nlow price per node\neasy monitoring\nmanaged load balancer (HAProxy)\nsimple reimaging\ndedicated NVMe SSD’s for our ETDC cluster\nGDPR compliant<p>In the long run, we want to scale to hundreds of servers per data center. We strive to have multiple data centers in the USA, Asia, Europe, Russia, and Latin America with ideally, as few providers as possible.<p>After having 20+ calls with hosting providers, it seemed that all of them would either be more expensive or did not provide what we required at scale.<p>We realized that it was unrealistic to secure and maintain our own hardware and keep our launch schedule on track at the same time.<p>Although we found multiple providers such as Contabo, SysEleven, and PlusServer, that could get the job done, we ultimately decided to collaborate with Plusserver to build our own datacenter on their new GAIA-X infrastructure.<p>We believe that trusting your infrastructure to be able to scale smoothly with you is the key requirement to be able to focus on your product.<p>We are more than thrilled to be working with the guys from PlusServer and whether or not this was a success, you can be the judge of, after testing Codesphere. :)<p>What are your experiences with infrastructure decisions? What can we do better?',

      url: null,
      author: 'matijash',
      points: 222,
      story_text:
        'Hi HN!<p>We are Martin and Matija, twin brothers and creators of Wasp (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasp-lang.dev" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasp-lang.dev</a>). Wasp is a declarative language that makes it really easy to build full-stack web apps while still using the latest technologies such as React, Node.js and Prisma.<p>Martin and I both studied computer science where we mostly focused on algorithms for bioinformatics. Afterwards we led engineering teams in several SaaS companies, on the way gaining plenty of experience in building web apps.<p>Moving from one project to another, we used various technologies:\nJQuery -&gt; Backbone -&gt; Angular -&gt; React, own scripts &#x2F; makefile -&gt; Grunt -&gt; Gulp -&gt; Webpack, PHP -&gt; Java -&gt; Node.js, … , and we always felt that things are harder than they should be. We were spending a lot of time adopting the latest tech stack and figuring out the best practices: how to make the web app performant, scalable, economical and secure and also how to connect all the pieces of the stack together.<p>While the tech stack kept advancing rapidly, the core requirements of the apps we were building changed very little (auth, routing, data model CRUD, ACL, …). That is why about 1.5 years ago we started thinking about separating web app specification (what it should do) from its implementation (how it should do it).<p>This led us to the idea of extracting common web app features and concepts into a special specification language from which we could generate code in the currently popular technologies. We don’t think it is feasible to replace everything with a single language so that is why we went with a DSL which integrates with the modern stack (right now React, NodeJS, Prisma).<p>Wasp lets you define high-level aspects of your web app (auth, routing, ACL, data models, CRUD) via a simple specification language and then write your specific logic in React and Node.js. The majority of the code is still being written in React and Node.js, with Wasp serving as the backbone of your whole application. To see some examples of what the language looks like in practice, take a look here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasp-lang&#x2F;wasp&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;examples&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;TodoApp&#x2F;main.wasp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasp-lang&#x2F;wasp&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;examples&#x2F;tutor...</a><p>The main difference between Wasp and frameworks (e.g. Meteor, Blitz, Redwood) is that Wasp is a language, not a library. One benefit of that is a simpler and cleaner, declarative syntax, focused on the requirements and detached from the implementation details.<p>Another benefit of a DSL is that it allows Wasp to understand the web app’s requirements during the build time and reason about it before generating the final code. For example, when generating code to be deployed to production, it could pick the most appropriate architecture based on its understanding of the web app and deploy it to serverless or another type of architecture (or even a combination). Another example would be reusing your data model logic through all the parts of the stack while defining it just once in Wasp. DSL opens the potential for optimisations, static analysis and extensibility.<p>Wasp’s compiler is built in Haskell and it compiles the source code in Wasp + React&#x2F;Node.js into the target code in just React and Node.js (currently in Javascript, but we plan to move to Typescript soon). The generated code is human readable and can easily be inspected and even ejected if Wasp becomes too limiting.<p>We are currently in Alpha and many features are still rough or missing, but you can try it out and build and deploy web apps! There are things we haven’t solved yet and others that will probably change as we progress.<p>You can check out our repo at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasp-lang&#x2F;wasp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wasp-lang&#x2F;wasp</a> and give it a try at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasp-lang.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wasp-lang.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;</a>.<p>Thank you for reading! We would love to get your feedback and also hear about your experiences building web apps - what has worked for you and where do you see the opportunities for improvement?',

        'Hi HN, Lyn &amp; Colin here. We’re co-founders of LayerCI (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;layerci.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;layerci.com</a>), which gives you a modern DevOps experience (CI&#x2F;CD &amp; staging environments) with as little work as writing a Dockerfile.<p>Most teams need CI&#x2F;CD (run the build and deploy every time a developer pushes) or staging (host a server with my app in it to share), but current approaches always have at least one of these problems:<p>- Simplistic (only run unit tests)<p>- Slow (wait 10 minutes to run the same repetitive setup steps like &quot;npm install&quot;)<p>- Complex (cache keys, base images, a slack channel to reserve staging servers, …)<p>We’ve spent over a year iterating with our customers to build a product that solves all of these problems.<p>Our configuration files (Layerfiles) look like Dockerfiles, so regular developers can write and maintain them. Here&#x27;s one that creates a staging server for create-react-app:<p>FROM vm&#x2F;ubuntu:18.04<p>RUN curl -sS <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.yarnpkg.com&#x2F;debian&#x2F;pubkey.gpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dl.yarnpkg.com&#x2F;debian&#x2F;pubkey.gpg</a> | sudo apt-key add - &amp;&amp; \n    curl -fSsL <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deb.nodesource.com&#x2F;setup_12.x" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deb.nodesource.com&#x2F;setup_12.x</a> | bash &amp;&amp; \n    apt-get install nodejs python3 make gcc build-essential<p>COPY . .<p>RUN npm install<p>RUN npm test<p>RUN BACKGROUND npm start<p>EXPOSE WEBSITE <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost:3000" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost:3000</a><p>We charge a flat $42&#x2F;mo&#x2F;developer on our paid plan. Because it&#x27;s a flat fee and not usage based, we&#x27;re incentivized to make things as fast as possible: Our current margins come from a custom-built hibernating hypervisor that lets us avoid running &quot;npm install&quot; thousands of times per day.<p>We’ve upgraded the free tier to 5GB of memory for new installations this week. It’s perfect for personal projects or small MVPs where you’d like a powerful demo server that will build on every push and automatically hibernate when it’s not being used.<p>The easiest way to try out LayerCI is to follow our interactive tutorial: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;layerci.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;layerci.com&#x2F;</a> or look at the docs: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;layerci.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;layerci.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;</a><p>We would love to hear your thoughts about CI&#x2F;CD, staging, and what we’ve built!',

Python, NodeJS and Java. Now that I am the manager, I want them to move to a unified code base. What is the best way to start this conversation? Ideally, I want all of them to have a python code base so that other teams can easily onboard.',

        'Hi all. I am not very good with networking so I need some clarification.<p>I am testing some virtual servers with a German provider that would help me save a ton of money since my budget is very limited unfortunately.<p>I am happy with the performance of the servers but these don&#x27;t have private networking enabled (it&#x27;s kinda an old school VPS provider rather than a cloud provider, with several limitations but very cheap), so I need to use the public IPs for the communication between the nodes.<p>I set up a Kubernetes cluster with some of these virtual servers, and have configured Linstor for storage and volumes are replicated across nodes for high availability. I used the Piraeus operator to set this up, but for now I have configured this without encryption because that would affect performance significantly and the network port speed isn&#x27;t very high (&lt; 1Gbps).<p>My question is, if the traffic required to consume volumes from pods and replicate them across nodes happens only between nodes in the same data center and not with the outside, can anyone intercept this traffic somehow?<p>The tech support of this provider says:\n&quot;All traffic in our network has to pass through our core-routers, additionally switch ports are configured in such a way that they only accept ethernet frames with mac addresses originating from these routers. Consequently, no layer-2 traffic is forwarded between switch ports and direct communication between servers, even when on the same subnet, is not possible.\nIn general traffic will, of course, not be intercepted from our end and any other customer as they cannot sniff traffic due to the prior mentioned reason that layer2 communication is generally not forwarded. &quot;<p>So this sounds like other customers cannot intercept my traffic, which is good. But can any 3rd parties from outside the data center somehow intercept the traffic if it&#x27;s between nodes and doesn&#x27;t leave the data center?<p>Thanks in advance!',

It should be on my website interface and shouldn&#x27;t redirect to the zoom website for meetings. I want these integration done by PHP because whole the website is developed on PHP and there would some data stored in the database regards to meetings&#x2F;classes. I searched a lot for this on google but couldn&#x27;t find a way to do it in PHP. I think it may be something easy for JavaScript developers as mostly guidance&#x2F;tutorials&#x2F;ways for JavaScript&#x2F;nodejs. But I&#x27;m unable to find a way for that in PHP.<p>Maybe there would another way rather than using zoom to achieve the goal.<p>I&#x27;m just posting here to get the idea if that is possible in PHP or someone has done it in past and provide me some information&#x2F;help regards to this project.<p>Any suggestions and help would be highly appreciatable.<p>Thanks!!!',

      url: null,
      author: 'jakemoshenko',
      points: 112,
      story_text:
        'Hi HN! We are Jake [jakemoshenko], Joey [jschorr], and Jimmy [jzelinskie] of Petricorp (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;petricorp.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;petricorp.io</a>). We’re building authorization services that reduce the overhead of adding a complex authorization policy to your apps and internal resources.<p>We’ve been building developer services and tools for over 15 years, and throughout that time we’ve repeatedly run into the problem where whatever authorization solution we pick for a new service at first, turns into a major limitation later down the road. Relational database backed libraries like the ones found in popular web frameworks have proven inflexible and a scaling bottleneck, and distributed policy engines such as Open Policy Agent [1] turn the evaluation scalability problem into one of distribution and consistency. In the past, we’ve even had to shelve product features because the effort required to safely alter the policy and migrate the data was higher than the value of the feature!<p>To solve these problems we’re building a multi-tenant SaaS platform based on Google’s Zanzibar paper [2], which allows for flexible tenant-defined policy, at planet scale. This new platform offers the consistent experience of a centralized auth solution, with the scalable nature of a distributed system. By taking on the operational overhead of running the platform ourselves and providing users with client libraries that reduce complexity, we&#x27;re shouldering the burden to enable authorization decisions that are fast, accurate, and accessible across applications.<p>Today we’re launching our first product integrated with that platform: ShareWith (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sharewith.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sharewith.io</a>). ShareWith brings Google-docs style sharing to anything that you can run behind a reverse proxy or authenticate with OpenID Connect (OIDC) [3]. We think ShareWith is a great alternative to VPNs, which are hard to set up and configure, hard to federate access to, and don’t allow for fine-grained permissions or sharing with people outside of your organization.<p>We’ve already found a few interesting uses of the service: We secure traffic to our own internal dashboards by running them behind OAuth2 Proxy [4] instances configured with ShareWith. Other companies are using it to avoid building the boilerplate for adding sharing and permissions into their products entirely!<p>Because organizations in ShareWith are billed per unique participants that have had resources shared with them, the pricing model shouldn&#x27;t inhibit protecting new things. Adding another service or adding an existing user to a new service doesn’t impose any additional cost.<p>ShareWith website protection is implemented using an extended OIDC provider. Normally, an OIDC provider is responsible only for returning an identity. Our provider will also match up a given access request with a pre-designated authorization requirement, and then check that the requestor has had that access shared with them. If not, we will pause the authentication flow and give them an option to request access, which notifies the owner: a familiar pattern to anyone who has ever had to request access to a document.<p>Underneath the hood, we are making dozens of requests to our platform, from writing and updating policy, to the individual access control checks. To answer an authorization check request, we first build a graph containing edges and nodes from both the policy and the individual relationships between users, groups, and resources. We then take that graph and attempt to find a path from the resource to the user. Once a path is found, or no such path can be found, the service informs the caller of the decision. Thanks to the distributed nature of the service, these answers are quickly computed by building and evaluating subgraphs in parallel, and each piece of data is replicated to ensure reliability.<p>Try out what we’ve built so far by following our guide (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sharewith.io&#x2F;first&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sharewith.io&#x2F;first&#x2F;</a>) to protect an example service. If you want updates from the team, be sure to sign up for our mailing list (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sharewith.io&#x2F;newsletter" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sharewith.io&#x2F;newsletter</a>) or follow us at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;petricorpio" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;petricorpio</a>. If you&#x27;re interested in integrating with our underlying authorization platform, you can reach out to us directly at hn@petricorp.io.<p>We&#x27;ve learned a lot building ShareWith, but now we want to hear what you think about what we’ve built so far, and the direction in which we’re heading!

        'With decentralized Social Networking (SN) platforms such as Diaspora, Mastodon, Manyverse, etc. it seems like a no-brainer for many people to implement both personal and small group nodes that can either run standalone or in a federated environment.<p>It seems that there are a number of blockers to widespread adoption.  Some of those are:<p>1.  Inertia.  Most folks are already on centralized SN platforms, as are their contacts, friends and family;<p>2.  Complex installations[0] keep many folks from even attempting to install such platforms;<p>3.  Lack of symmetric, high-speed broadband access limits the ability to self-host such platforms;<p>4.  Limited&#x2F;expensive access to domain names, DNS hosting[1] and static addressing (in the absence of widespread IPv6 adoption by consumer ISPs).<p>Given that most consumer-grade computing systems are mostly idle and storage costs continue to plummet, the argument for decentralized platforms just becomes better and better.<p>As such, why aren&#x27;t more folks promoting them and&#x2F;or developing mechanisms for broader access&#x2F;acceptance?<p>[0] Yes, there are Docker images for many of these platforms, but implementation&#x2F;adoption of Docker is limited and most of these platforms require significant IT and development knowledge&#x2F;skills to implement.<p>[1] This could also be addressed via containerization, but there seems to be limited interest in promoting such self-hosted platforms.',

        'After a year of writing, my book Distributed Systems with Node.js was finally published today! The book is available here:<p>Paperback from O&#x27;Reilly (use code DSWN20 for 20% off):\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;shop.aer.io&#x2F;oreilly&#x2F;p&#x2F;distributed-systems-with&#x2F;9781492077299-9149<p>Paperback from Amazon:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Distributed-Systems-Node-js-Building-Enterprise-Ready&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1492077291<p>Kindle from Amazon:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Distributed-Systems-Node-js-Building-Enterprise-Ready-ebook&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B08MTJ4H6L<p>My intent with this book is to prove that Node.js is just as capable as traditional enterprise platforms (like Java or .NET) for building services that are observable, scalable, and resilient. It&#x27;s very hands-on and readers will write application code and integrate it with tooling from various layers of a modern service stack.<p>For example, readers will encapsulate two applications using Docker, run a private container registry to host images, deploy to Kubernetes, configure health checks, scale the instance count, and allow the apps to communicate with each other. Readers will send logs to Elasticsearch, build a dashboard with Kibana, send metrics to StatsD&#x2F;Graphite, build another dashboard with Graphite, transmit request spans and visualize request hierarchies with Zipkin. They&#x27;ll even configure a CI pipeline, run unit tests, enforce code coverage, and deploy to a production server. And that isn&#x27;t even half of it!<p>I wrote this book as a Node.js developer who loves writing code that runs on the server but who doesn&#x27;t have much interest in frontend development. Node.js developers often get stereotyped into being frontend developers and I hope that this book can help bring an end to that.<p>Let me know if you have any questions!',

        'When doing research or just navigating I find myself opening multiple tabs that I wan&#x27;t to deep dive in later but never have the time to. This leads to leaving multiple tabs open in my browser which I eventually group in different windows but still leave untouched. After some days&#x2F;weeks I sometimes save each &quot;Research Session&quot; window in a Session using FFs Tab Session Manager extension. However, the flow of that research session is lost.<p>Is there any extension or tool with which one can visualize the web history as a graph, seeing which site lead to which and maybe clustering nodes by topic?<p>How do you personally keep track of such sessions? I am too lazy to transfer the knowledge from those sites to some knowledge base or to use bookmarks with categories (I like the idea of being aware of the referral that brought me to a particular site).',

I really like to write code and create stuff via code. But for the last year or so, I no longer can find passion or any meaningful side project any more.<p>I always remember myself starting different projects. I didn&#x27;t stick to any of them, most of them died in shame, other are living their last breaths in my private gitlab or public github.<p>I&#x27;ve spend my last years learning new languages or frameworks, or trying different areas: NodeJs, TypeScript - which eventually got me the job I have, Kotlin with Desktop development, Rust for game development, Unity for game development.<p>I have the initial passion to start and learn but eventually I realize - its bigger than I can handle. Its either a SaSS that is too ambitious, or a game I&#x27;ll never finish because I only code and I need artist&#x2F;models&#x2F;sfx&#x2F;ui&#x2F;game design.<p>Maybe I lack dedication, maybe I want quick results. Maybe I just jump into something without knowing what the final product should be. Or maybe I aim too high and too big. But I no longer have any ideas for a side projects. I really like programming, but I simply can&#x27;t find a field &#x2F; project that I can stay dedicated to.<p>I can&#x27;t seem to find &quot;life area&quot; that I can improve (a classic side project path - find something in life that is missing and create it). I can&#x27;t find any open source project I am really connected to so that I will be willing to contribute back. Maybe I am just lazy. Or maybe I&#x27;m just not good enough.<p>I really feel a hole inside since I do miss fun programming outside of work hours, but I really don&#x27;t know how to fill this void.<p>How do I find and stick to a side project that will fulfill my passion to programming?',

        'I want to learn more about the domain of creating time series predictions for paired comparison outcomes, e.g. taking historical box scores and predicting future box scores.<p>One of the primary challenges is that such data includes both numeric features (e.g. box stats) and contextual labels (e.g. teams), making each observation both relative and coupled.<p>Perhaps the most natural representation of such data is a time-dependent graph, where the comparisons represent edges between two nodes (competitors). Unfortunately, this kind of graph structure appears to preclude naive applications of ANNs developed for tabular and sequence data (e.g. LSTMs, transformers, etc).<p>Does anyone know of any good references that demonstrate how to account for the graph structure of such problems? Is it a terrible idea to essentially one-hot encode the adjacency matrix and provide it as an input to an LSTM or Transformer architecture? Are there more efficient ways to encode paired comparisons?<p>I tried something like a neural network version of Elo with more features (i.e. RNN), but I suspect I was suffering from exploding&#x2F;vanishing gradients since I was chaining the same hidden layer update step for thousands of games.<p>Any advice or direction here would be much appreciated!',

      story_text:
        'I&#x27;ve been working on something for a while now. It&#x27;s a combination of a decentralised identity system and a decentralised messaging system that makes use of the aforementioned new identity system.<p>It&#x27;s based on cryptographic keys with one major property: keys are paired with arbitrary mnemonic strings, e.g. your favourite username, so apps can send messages in a P2P fashion addressed to the strings directly without having to worry about IP addresses. These key-string pairs can be generated on-the-fly on any computer and there&#x27;s no central database. When multiple people inevitably choose the same strings as their identifiers, e.g. 5 people choose &#x27;alice&#x27;, the system has a consensus mechanism for resolving such conflicts across the entire network so &#x27;alice&#x27; will always point to one public key that all nodes will use at a given point in time for encryption and signature verification. This means that only that specific &#x27;alice&#x27; will receive any messages sent to that identifier. The other 4 people won&#x27;t be able to read them.<p>I&#x27;ve written two papers describing both systems:<p>* Nomicle: A decentralised, identity-based, cryptography system [ http:&#x2F;&#x2F;noraco.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;xp002&#x2F;docs&#x2F;XP002.pdf ]<p>* xTalk: A Nomicle-powered, inter-app messaging system [ http:&#x2F;&#x2F;noraco.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;hp001&#x2F;docs&#x2F;HP001.pdf ]<p>I plan on releasing the source code and documentation some time later this month. It&#x27;s all written in Python. Nomicle&#x27;s code includes a Python library as well as a C library that developers can use to integrate it into their apps. I&#x27;m trying to make it as easy and simple as possible for anyone to pick up. These are the first projects in a pipeline of open source projects that build on this work and that I intend to work on and release in the near future. Messaging is one potential use of Nomicle, but I can already see more uses such as consensus-based packet routing and information publishing. In fact, the latter is the next project I&#x27;ll be working on.',

      story_text:
        'Metcalfe&#x27;s Law says that the value of a network is proportional to the number of nodes (or people) in the network.  That is, V = k * n^2, for some constant k.<p>But we now know that there&#x27;s more to the story.  That valuable network attracts users, but it also attracts <i>abusers</i> - spammers, propagandists, trolls.  They don&#x27;t <i>add</i> to the value of the network; they <i>detract</i> from it.<p>Here&#x27;s where the handwaving starts.  It is my perception that the proportion of abusers rises as the size of the network rises.  That means that the total number of abusers rises faster than the number of users - perhaps as the square of the number of users.<p>Worse, those abusers do more damage than their numbers would indicate.  It&#x27;s not just that you have messages that should be ignored.  It&#x27;s also that you have to increase the level of mistrust for <i>every</i> message.  I&#x27;m going to guess that the abusers do damage about in proportion to the square of their number (which is itself in proportion to the square of the number of users).<p>That leaves us with V = k * n^2 - c * n^4, to account for the damage from abuse.<p>It follows that one essential of larger networks is keeping c as low as possible.  Otherwise abuse destroys a network.<p>Also note that, for any given k and c, there is a number of users beyond which the value of the network is <i>negative</i>.',

        'Some time ago the Tidal music streaming service stopped working at my home. I wrote to their support but it took weeks to get a reply. \nInitially they told me that my IP was on a blocking list (RBL) and this was the reason. \nI got removed from that list (it was some irrelevant RBL nobody uses) but Tidal did still not work.<p>I eventually got one of their more tech savvy supporters (like that is a thing - NOT!) which told me that my IP was blocked because somebody was abusing it for a Tor Exit node. He even linked to a page that listed my IP as having a tor node (clearly stating that it was NOT an Exit Node). \nI told them that the Tor Node was mine and left there intentionally to support the Tor Network + for my network tech research.<p>Their answer was that I could change my IP or use a VPN (or kill my Tor Node of course!) if I wanted to continue to use Tidal.<p>Neither of those options are possible for me so as I need to Tor node for work research, my IP is static and &quot;rented&quot; for 10 years to come. VPN is just not possible for every device in the house that would normally run Tidal.<p>I guess that Tidal just don&#x27;t want to have customers anymore.<p>So what should Tidals Argument be for blocking IP&#x27;s with a tor node? I mean, I will be able to get many IP addresses blocked simply by turning on the Tor Browser while using some network. It seems like a stupid decision made by people who do not know how Tor works.',

        'Hello Hacker News!<p>We&#x27;re Iván and Erin, two students from the MLH Fellowship (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fellowship.mlh.io&#x2F;), and as a capstone project for the Fellowship we built Nodemaker, an automatic node generator for n8n (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;n8n.io), a workflow automation tool.<p>Nodemaker: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;MLH-Fellowship&#x2F;nodemaker<p>As we spent all summer contributing nodes to the n8n codebase, we realized there was an untapped opportunity to automate much of the nodemaking process, which often involves writing TypeScript files with a specific structure, while ensuring that all the various codebase conventions are followed, and completing a large number of time-consuming tasks every time a new node is created.<p>By automating this process, Nodemaker helps n8n developers work faster, allowing them to focus on the logic of their nodes and forget about minor details. And in turn, Nodemaker also helps n8n maintainers review nodes faster, as they can be sure that codebase conventions are being followed.<p>The n8n project was originally discussed here:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21191676<p>If you have any questions, let us know!',

We feel, this community could help.<p>And reason why it is blocked in the first place (apart from curtailing spam) without any prior notification or consent from the customer?<p>Is it documented somewhere that we missed to see and what other restrictions linode has on it&#x27;s servers?<p>Had we known all these things, we would not have created the account &#x2F; servers on linode.<p>Now moving to another provider and setting up the systems again from scratch is a lot of work.<p>Any new linode account creators, beware of the restrictions on linode servers, limitations on linode servers, issues with linode servers and requesting everyone to be updated about the linode restrictions.',

Consul, etcd and Zookeeper are a kind of infrastructure services that are generally deployed in a pretty standard way. Because you need at least 3 nodes in a cluster for HA, running your own cluster will be relatively expensive for small services.<p>I was wondering if there is any interest here in a shared, multi-tenant, HA Consul&#x2F;etcd&#x2F;Zookeeper cluster?<p>The idea would be that instead of paying to run your own 3-5 nodes in an HA configuration, someone else would do it for you, but multiple tenants would use the same cluster - so you&#x27;d only pay something like $10&#x2F;m instead of several times that.',

Being a full time OSS contributor is a difficult path to move forward. I attempted to help monetize OSS packages by building a marketplace (privjs.com) for &quot;PRO&quot; nodejs libraries where OSS developers could release a PRO version of their existing libraries and help cater the paid users better. Posted it on reddit and it was flooded with hate comments.<p>I just do not understand - what&#x27;s wrong in monetizing OSS? And, why is it so hard to monetize? Why do people hate paying for code that saves hours&#x2F;days of their time?<p>-Prasanna',

        'I&#x27;ve been a Django backend engineer for most of my career of 7 years, and recently shifted to working on NodeJS+Express because the current company runs on it.<p>So, is it okay to stick to Django in 2020? The last project I made in Django - I used v3.0 and it was still fine although a lot had changed from v1.11. Except of course I forgot DRF a bit and had to throw out some APIs I wrote in it before deciding to roll out my own way in CBVs as going back to docs for custom stuff in DRF was too complicated&#x2F;required unnecessary efforts. Same for allauth, drf-rest-auth, etc. Okay for basic APIs, not as much for customization. Sorry for the digression. And Django 3.0 still doesn&#x27;t have event loop based async processing like Node, at least not fully.<p>Honestly, after working with Node+Express and having to write all the &quot;magic&quot; parts yourself, I feel more light and free, - not having to understand a framework and then thinking about my app&#x27;s business logic later. In Node+Express I can simply scaffold a basic server and start writing routes, integrate with SQL queries, and be done with it. Maybe even install a couple of libs to sort out CORS, session auth, security stuff etc. And the performance is definitely better than running a Django app for simple serialization of DB data and sending that back. The biggest pain is obviously Django ORM - it&#x27;s honestly light years ahead of anything in JS. But I can live without it, having spent a year on manually created migrations in my company that I know can be automated.<p>So, what do you use and recommend for backend development in 2020?\nWhen you have to write a POC quickly for an app idea you have, what&#x27;s the technology you use to flesh its backend out?<p>P.S: This is not a rant against Django - I love Django and my whole career started because of it. I&#x27;m forever thankful to the Django community and Django itself. I just want to gain some insights into what other Django devs have been using regularly.',

Often the \n     database is the bottleneck\n   - maintaining a proxy&#x2F;dispatcher just adds more complexity to handle when errors happen.\n</code></pre>\nDon’t get me wrong, I like JS as much as other languages. I’m just feeling some JS developers, compared to other languages developers, are pushing a bit too hard to inject their favorite languages everywhere, even that doesn’t make much sense in terms of architecture.<p>Love to hear your thoughts and experiences here.',

My best language is Python, though I am not against using PHP or some other language. I am familiar with HTML and CSS, but not great with JavaScript yet. In my case, it would be something similar to a community site (like a small social network) with a newsfeed, p2p chat, mailbox, forum (preferably VBulletin) etc. and would need to be mobile friendly. I know that I will use PostgreSQL due to spatial data types, likely Nginx, probably on AWS.<p>Over the years, there have been many trends in web development such as Ruby on Rails in 2006. Now, there are so many JavaScript front end packages like React, Vue and Angular, and even for back end work like NodeJS. In 2020, I am lost as to all of the options and if all of these decisions need to be made before working on a project of this size.<p>Obviously, this is a vague question and heavily depends on the use case, but I am interested to hear if HN has suggestions on things to consider and what to think about when deciding. What do you think is the best tech for a web app these days, in 2020?',

        'This is the email I&#x27;ve received a few days ago:<p>Hello Google Kubernetes Engine Customer,<p>We are writing to let you know that as part of ensuring better representation of available resources on the node for e2 burstable node types, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) has decided to reduce the allocatable CPU resources available to schedule user workloads (known as the node allocatable resources) on e2-micro, e2-small, and e2-medium machine types.<p>What do I need to know?<p>Today, e2-micro, e2-small and e2-medium have 1930 mCPU of allocatable resources for Kubernetes to schedule Pods on per node, and following this change, it will be 940mCPU. Kubernetes uses the node allocatable resources during scheduling to decide how many Pods it should place on the node. If your workloads are currently requesting more CPU resources than what will be available after upgrading, they may become unscheduled after upgrade.<p>We are making this change in order to more accurately represent the resources available in these machine types. These machine types can temporarily burst to 2 vCPUs as documented, but this is not sustained. Note that the underlying compute capabilities and resources are not changing, the machines retain the ability to temporarily burst to 2 vCPU, this change only affects how many resources the Kubernetes scheduler considers when allocating Pods to nodes.<p>When your cluster is upgraded to 1.16.8-gke.17 or 1.17.5-gke.5 or later (whether you perform this manually or you are automatically upgraded), your workloads may become unscheduled if there are not enough allocatable resources in the cluster.',

But there is virtually ZERO examples or OSS projects that talk about B2B multi-tenant apps! The worst part is that even companies like Google Cloud don&#x27;t provide an example.<p>What I&#x27;m looking for is: A SaaS app that allows people to create tenants (companies), and allows admin of the tenant to login and manage group of users, keep track of billing for each tenant, have super-admin who can access any tenant. But the rest of the app code is shared across the tenants.\nI&#x27;m looking for code that&#x27;s either in Java or JavaScript(NodeJS). Are you in the same boat as me? If not, could you please point me to something? I really appreciate that!',

It should be 6.<p>Let&#x27;s just add an &lt;input&gt; like this:<p>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;&#x2F;head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;input&gt;&lt;&#x2F;body&gt;&lt;&#x2F;html&gt;\nReload the snippet on a new tab and count the DOM Nodes, it should be 9.<p>Then, run this in the console to remove the &lt;input&gt;<p>document.getElementsByTagName(&#x27;input&#x27;)[0].remove()\nThe count should be 6, which is as expected.<p>Finally, reload the snipped on a new tab again. Make sure the DOM Nodes show 9 and then type some text in the &lt;input&gt; field. You will notice that DOM Nodes increase by one, reaching 10, this is the entered #text that is added into the DOM tree. So far so good.<p>Now let&#x27;s remove the &lt;input&gt; as before with:<p>document.getElementsByTagName(&#x27;input&#x27;)[0].remove()\nSee the DOM Nodes, they are still 10 as if nothing was removed.<p>Any thoughts?',

If you have any other suggestions I would gladly hear them.<p>I&#x27;m not deploying on AWS or Azure so I don&#x27;t really mind ram usage or cpu usage. The database will probably be PostGreSQL because I want a boring (in a good way) database on this project.

        'Hi everyone,<p>we developed a Java library for optimisation under uncertainty. It offers the user quick access to modelling of the decision problem, stochastic processes and solving of stochastic programs. Modelling typically involves various ML techniques (time series, clustering, all kinds of regression). So far, we used Py as a wrapper language to allow for quick prototyping in Jupyter. However, shipping solutions based on Py proved unreliable.<p>We would like to switch to a different stack to achieve 2 things: 1) Rapid prototyping with our Java library in the background and 2) Ability to offer a web-based solution (a la NodeJS &#x2F; React). We were thinking Scala &#x2F; Groovy &#x2F; Koitlin + NodeJS + React.<p>Our main issue is that none of the options offer nice data wrangling capabilities similar to Pandas in Py + dynamic typing + well-maintained Jupyter kernel. Does anyone have any other ideas?<p>Thanks!',

        'I&#x27;m working on a SaaS that has a feature that allows users to create forms that their customers can fill in.<p>On the back of a form submission, customers can configure actions to happen within the SaaS (e.g. create an event, update an item, send an email, invoke a webhook, etc).<p>We&#x27;re looking to take this further and allow customers to be able to invoke other tools such as posting a message to a Slack channel or creating a Google Calendar entry.<p>We don&#x27;t want to be stuck building out and maintaining a bunch of these custom integrations, we&#x27;d rather simply integrate an existing tool within our codebase (is Apache Camel an option here) or potentially back onto another SaaS that manages that for us.<p>A lot of this will be API-driven to begin with. Practically what I&#x27;m hoping to achieve (for an initial version at least) is the following:<p><pre><code>  &quot;actions&quot;: [\n    {\n      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;SEND_EMAIL&quot;,\n      &quot;options&quot;: {\n        &quot;recipients&quot;: &quot;{{response.email}}&quot;,\n        &quot;body&quot;: &quot;Hello {{response.name}}&quot;\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;SEND_SLACK_MESSAGE&quot;,\n      &quot;options&quot;: {\n        &quot;channel&quot;: &quot;#channel_id&quot;,\n        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Hello {{response.name}}&quot;,\n        &quot;token&quot;: &quot;slack_token&quot;\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;CREATE_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_EVENT&quot;,\n      &quot;options&quot;: {\n        &quot;date&quot;: &quot;{{response.date}}&quot;,\n        &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Client Meeting: {{response.name}}&quot;,\n        &quot;guests&quot;: &quot;{{response.email}}&quot;\n        &quot;token&quot;: &quot;google_token&quot;\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m familiar with tools such as Zapier, IFTT, tray.io. I was wondering if any of these are suitable for this use case. Or would something like Apache Camel (or something for NodeJS) be more suitable?',

        'Idea: stop merchants from tracking all your purchases by creating something like the Tor network for credit&#x2F;debit cards.<p>Maybe it works something like this: create a co-op financial institution that issues credit&#x2F;debit cards. Each time you use a card from this co-op, it runs the transaction under an alias card number. You still get charged properly on the back end, but the merchant sees a different name and card number. To use Tor-parlance, imagine the different card numbers as different &quot;exit nodes.&quot;<p>Would it be possible to create something like this? I&#x27;m hoping someone who understand the nuts and bolts of how credit&#x2F;debit cards work can chime in.<p>Example:<p>Here are five people and their card numbers:<p><pre><code>  | Name      | Card Number         |\n  |-----------|---------------------|\n  | Donna Doe | 1111 1111 1111 1111 |\n  | Carla Coe | 1111 1111 1111 1112 |\n  | Brett Boe | 1111 1111 1111 1113 |\n  | Ralph Roe | 1111 1111 1111 1114 |\n  | Paula Poe | 1111 1111 1111 1115 |\n</code></pre>\nDonna Doe goes to the same supermarket every day for five days. Every day, she uses the same credit card (number 1111 1111 1111 1111). Even though the same card is swiped every day, the merchant sees five different names and card numbers. Example of what cards might randomly come up on those five card swipes:<p>Day 1:\nPaula Poe - 1111 1111 1111 1115<p>Day 2:\nCarla Coe - 1111 1111 1111 1112<p>Day 3:\nDonna Doe - 1111 1111 1111 1111<p>Day 4:\nRalph Roe - 1111 1111 1111 1114<p>Day 5:\nBrett Boe - 1111 1111 1111 1113<p>( I posted the same question to Reddit here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;fintech&#x2F;comments&#x2F;frhbw3&#x2F;could_we_create_a_torlike_system_for_debitcredit&#x2F; )',

We are running a NodeJS application with a MongoDB on Kubernetes and can have thus pods of different versions running concurrently when deploying a new version (we currently perform rolling updates).<p>Some options we have been considering:<p>1. Using an evolutionary database design (only adding fields to the schema) and having the newer version write both the old and new.\n2. Extracting the DB repository to an external versionable service that reads&#x2F;write from the DB and returns a different schema version depending on what application version requests an entity.<p>Further suggestions are greatly appreciated!',

Managed K8S by DigitalOcean seems to be like the good option, but I am not sure I want to pull in the complexity of k8s for a team as small as ours.<p>What would you do in my situation?<p>ps. are databases like postgres supposed to be running inside containers and not on bare metal?

        'Now Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for orchestrating containerized workloads running in the data center, and rely on the stable network of the data center.<p>But in scenarios such as smart park management or CDN，we will run the master in the data center, and the edge nodes in various decentralized areas. At this time, there is no stable network connection between K8s master and edge node, and the node may even be offline for a long time. This indeed caused troubles: the control events from the master to the edge nodes may be lost, which cause troubles for the edge applications management.<p>KubeEdge（project under CNCF） provides a reliable message transmission mechanism，the details： https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;kubeedge&#x2F;kubeedge&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;docs&#x2F;proposals&#x2F;reliable-message-delivery.md',

        'StellarGraph is an open-source library featuring state-of-the-art graph machine learning algorithms. The project is delivered as part of CSIRO’s Data61.<p>Dramatically improved memory usage is the key feature of the 0.10 release of the library, with the StellarGraph and StellarDiGraph classes now backed by NumPy and Pandas. This will enable significant performance benefits.<p>Version 0.10 (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stellargraph&#x2F;stellargraph&#x2F;releases&#x2F;tag&#x2F;v0.10.0) also features two new algorithms:<p>- Link prediction with directed GraphSAGE<p>- GraphWave, which computes structural node embeddings by using wavelet transforms on the graph Laplacian.<p>Other new algorithms and features remain under active development, but are available in this release as experimental previews. These include:<p>- Temporal Random Walks: random walks that respect the time that each edge occurred (stored as edge weights)<p>- Watch Your Step: computes node embeddings by simulating the effect of random walks, rather than doing them<p>- ComplEx: computes embeddings for nodes and edge types in knowledge graphs, and uses these to perform link prediction<p>- Neo4j connector: the GraphSAGE algorithm can execute neighbourhood sampling from a Neo4j database, so the edges of a graph do not have to fit into memory.<p>The new release also incorporates key bug fixes and improvements:<p>- StellarGraph now supports TensorFlow 2.1<p>- Demos now focus on Jupyter notebooks<p>- Supervised GraphSAGE Node Attribute Inference algorithm is now reproducible<p>- Code for saliency maps&#x2F;interpretability refactored to have more sharing, making it cleaner and easier to extend<p>- Demo notebooks predominantly tested on CI using Papermill, so won&#x27;t become out of date.<p>Find StellarGraph on GitHub (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;stellargraph&#x2F;stellargraph).<p>We welcome your feedback and contributions.<p>Until next time, the StellarGraph team.',

How much effort and money would it take to get that project online? Many novice programmers like students wouldn&#x27;t even know where to start.<p>I created a new platform where you as a developer are not exposed to the underlying infrastructure at all. Instead you just upload your code and the platform does its magic to setup your application to run.<p>Imagine a platform where you don&#x27;t have to setup any low level details like servers, load-balancers, or DNS, but you still get fun tools like logs, analytics, metrics, CICD pipeline, and much more out of the box. To top that off, your application gets deployed in multiple servers around the world, so anyone can access your site from anywhere with the same speed.<p>There is a very early beta version that you can check out right now. Docs here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plugins.quadnix.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;introduction.html<p>Do you have a project that you want to get online? Have feedback &#x2F; questions? Please reach out.',

        'We now use a DigitalOceans managed database with 0 standby nodes, coupled with a droplet running Django. It is working good.<p>We are however thinking about switching to a new dedicated server at another provider (Hetzner) where we are looking at having the Web server and the DB on the same server, however the new server will have hugely improved performance (which is sometimes needed), still at a reduced cost compared to the DigitalOcean setup.<p>The thing we are doubting is if having a managed db is worth it. The sell in is that everything is of course managed. But what does this mean in reality? Updating packages is easy, backups as well (to some extent), and we still do not use any standby nodes and doubt we will need any replication. So far we have never had the need to recover anything (about 5 years). Before we got the managed db we had it in the same machine (as we are now looking at going back to) and never had any issues.<p>Any input?',

Essentially my requirements are a system that allows for hierarchical categorisation of books, and is easily navigable from the terminal.<p>The solution I&#x27;ve come up with is to use the filesystem as a &quot;category tree&quot; (so I might have &quot;.&#x2F;Computer Science&#x2F;Abstract Interpretation&#x2F;...&quot;, or &quot;.&#x2F;Mathematics&#x2F;Mathematical Logic&#x2F;...&quot;) with softlinks to directories in a hidden &quot;store&quot; which actually contain the books as the leaf nodes; this way I can have the same book in multiple categories, and I find it very easy to find whatever I&#x27;m looking for. I&#x27;ve found this works particularly well when combined with a terminal file manager such as ranger, and a fuzzy searcher such as fzf.<p>I&#x27;ve written a small tool which parses YAML metadata files inside the store and automatically generates the library structure based on the categories I assign.<p>I&#x27;d be interested to hear if anyone else has come up with a solution to this problem, or is aware of a pre-existing solution?',

We’re extremely excited to share this new primitive.<p>Besides the technical challenges building this project that folks here would find interesting (fixing the ZK proof compiler, modifying nodeJS V8 params etc.), we think this is a very novel use case for ZK tech, and ECDSA inside ZK-SNARKs is a starting point that unlocks many other ideas! :D<p>A summarized version of our README, with more thoughts on why you would want to enable this in the first place, is also in this Twitter thread[3]!<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hacklodge.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hacklodge.org</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;0xparc.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;0xparc.org</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;0xparc&#x2F;status&#x2F;1493363943036923912" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;0xparc&#x2F;status&#x2F;1493363943036923912</a>',

      title: 'Show HN: A Schemaless Data Store Within Your SQL Database',
      url: 'https://schemafreesql.com/',
      author: 'dfragnito',

      story_text:
        'Hi HN, we&#x27;re Eric and Dean, creators of SchemafreeSQL. Its roots go back to an on-line Web App Development Environment we developed back in 1999. It was comprised of an IDE, Web Server, Object Store, Virtual File System, Template System, and polyglot (Java, JavaScript, and Python). Of course, we named it “.OS”. Then we ended up dropping it. But that&#x27;s a story for another time. It was the ease of use of the Object Store from .OS that we really missed, which brings us back to SchemafreeSQL. It provides an enhanced API to your SQL Database which allows it to function as a Schemaless Objectstore. Yes, &quot;Schemaless Objectstore&quot; might be an oxymoron if you consider that objects have strict &quot;schemas&quot;. So what are we talking about here?<p>It started with a simple goal. We wanted to store data just as simply as one could throw a JSON document into a doc store, but while maintaining the power of the data&#x27;s relations and references in an object sense.<p>What we ended up with was a JSON over HTTP API (for ubiquitous access from any language), that maps any JSON structure into an optimized, static set of indexed tables in any SQL database (MySQL being our first port). Using it, we can immediately store any data we want, without having to create tables and indexes and optimize them.<p>Inserting data is as easy as sending a JSON doc to a doc store, but in SFSQL all nested relations inherent within that document are stored as objects and primitives. And, with a little extra JSON syntax we can use references and eliminate duplication of data (e.g. &quot;#ref&quot;: &quot;oid-goes-here&quot;), all from within the same source JSON doc. There is also no added speed penalty for referencing an object. In fact, all parent nodes in the JSON source data are stored as objects. So any object can be referenced from anywhere, allowing for complex relations (e.g. any-to-any), enabling rapid prototyping of data structures (no tables to create), and enabling unique on-the-fly relations if need be.<p>Queries are issued using JOIN-free SQL query syntax (e.g. SELECT COUNT(*) WHERE $s:person.address.state=&#x27;NY&#x27;) that eliminates the verbosity of the standard SQL JOIN, yet still maintains access to the primitive and aggregate functions of the underlying SQL database (e.g. FORMAT(), COUNT(), etc.) which simply get passed through.<p>What it&#x27;s not? It&#x27;s not a database on it&#x27;s own and it&#x27;s not a horizontally scalable big data store. Although, since it can extend practically any SQL database, it&#x27;s ability to scale is in large part tied to the scaling ability of the chosen SQL database that it&#x27;s extending. It&#x27;s also not an ORM as there is no strict mapping of objects in code to objects in the datastore. And yes, there were trade offs in it&#x27;s design. One design choice was that every primitive be indexed, which results in better performance than against a straight SQL table without the proper indexes, though slower than a straight SQL table with a composite index tailored to that query. But, the ability to JOIN to an existing SQL table within a SFSQL query is on the roadmap which will allow you have the best of both worlds (custom tables w&#x2F;custom indexes referenced from within a SFSQL query). As well, there is a situation one encounters in indexing choices (but that you won&#x27;t encounter with SFSQL) that we like to call the &quot;Index Permutation Limitation&quot;. Simply put, there is a real limit to the number of composite indexes that you can create for any table&#x2F;collection. This is especially a problem when - for instance - you want to give end users the ability to query across any of the possible attributes across the myriad product types that a big online store may carry. We get into detail on this point within our FAQ.<p>So what it is? \nIt&#x27;s an extension to SQL databases that makes storing and querying and modeling and just generally using a datastore... easier. We&#x27;re hoping it will stir up some interesting use-cases.<p>Thanks in advance for the feedback!',

      story_text:
        'Hello everyone!<p>I&#x27;ve been working on a solution that will allow me to write my front-end application in PHP. Why? - I wouldn&#x27;t say I liked the idea of using Node js on my servers for server-side rendering using Vue or Angular. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I work with .NET, Node js, Angular, and React every day at work and have nothing against it. But I needed a simple component with some data from a server and rendered using a template for my side-project. So, I started to think, can I convert my PHP code into Javascript? - Sure I can. Classes will become functions, private properties - local variables. Protected and the public will become public properties, etc. Something like this:<p>class TodoApp extends BaseComponent\n{\n    public string $text = &#x27;&#x27;;\n    public array $items = [];<p><pre><code>    public function handleSubmit()\n    {\n        $this-&gt;items[] = $this-&gt;text;\n        $this-&gt;text = &#x27;&#x27;;\n    }</code></pre>\n}<p>will become:\nvar TodoApp = function () {\n    var $this = this;\n    this.text = &#x27;&#x27;;\n    this.items = [];<p><pre><code>    this.handleSubmit = function (event) {\n        $this.items.push($this.text);\n        $this.text = &#x27;&#x27;;\n    };</code></pre>\n};<p>By following that pattern, I designed a first working prototype. It was pretty good but most important - it supported SSR out of the box. Later I added more and more features, like templating engine, reactivity, built-in PHP functions support, etc. And I could not stop. I continue improving it every day in my free time. As of today, Viewi is a fully functional tool for building full-stack and reactive web applications.<p>Link with some examples:\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;viewi.net&#x2F;<p>Documentation\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;viewi.net&#x2F;docs<p>Architecture design and idea\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;viewi.net&#x2F;docs&#x2F;architecture\nand here\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;viewi.net&#x2F;docs&#x2F;introduction<p>Tutorial\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;viewi.net&#x2F;tutorial<p>GitHub project\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;viewi&#x2F;viewi<p>I hope you will find something useful for yourself. Feel free to ask questions or leave feedback.<p>Thank you!',

        'The background of the question:<p>We are developing an open-source cloud-scalable vector database: Milvus[1]. In our new cloud architecture, we need to employ a messaging framework to serve as the central log sequence of the whole system. Ultimately, we will support well-known messaging solutions like Apache Kafka, Apache Pulsar, etc. Referring to Confluent&#x27;s article[2], Pulsar&#x27;s message consumption model is push-based, while Kafka&#x27;s is pull-based.<p>Our new cloud architecture is based on the actor model, which means all the worker nodes are working asynchronously, and the log sequence is the key to linking all the nodes. We think the push-based message consumption model and the actor model have more logical consistency. So we started with Apache Pulsar in our new implementation. We did have some concerns about Pulsar; for example,<p>- The project popularity<p>- The Go SDK is buggy<p>- The documentation is not as good as Kafka<p>We don&#x27;t think these points are showstoppers. However, some of our users have different thoughts. They are asking when we would support Kafka. Some of them even mentioned they won&#x27;t maintain Pulsar in their production environment.<p>So HN, please let me know your thoughts about this question. Should we give Kafka adoption a much higher priority since we just completed the new lease GA?<p>Reference:<p>[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;milvus.io<p>[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.confluent.io&#x2F;kafka-vs-pulsar&#x2F;',

        'GM to all,<p>We&#x27;ve been working on an opensource NPM package and tool https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nftoptions.app for creating options contracts on the Solana blockchain. The client is in nodejs https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npmjs.com&#x2F;package&#x2F;solana-options , with an onchain server written in Rust https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dbanda&#x2F;solana-nft-options<p>This package allows you to easily create options contracts for tokens on Solana, with specific expiry times and strike values on the blockchain in one line of code. Similarly, you can use it to mint tokens and create contracts on those tokens. This allows you to do things like mint an NFT for a piece of art and then sell a call contract to buy that NFT at a predefined price. Each contract is tied to an NFT too, so you can easily trade them as well.<p>The onchain program is currently available on Solana devnet and testnet. We hope to launch on mainnet soon and possibly drop the NFTs on platforms such as Solsea for easy exchange. Currently, the web app https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nftoptions.app only supports the Phantom wallet but we are looking to add more soon.<p>We are looking for feedback, contributors and testers. Issues can be filed on the GitHub. As always, any feedback is greatly appreciated.<p>Thanks y’all.',

        'Hi everyone, My friend is hosting a 4 week group building session to code up an Amazon clone. He&#x27;s ex-facebook and is looking to keep his skills sharp while looking for the next gig. Over four weeks, They’ll work with various technologies including reactjs and nodejs, so feel free to join them if you’re interested in the topic.<p>I’ve joined previous cohorts and found it motivating to complete projects with a group in the past, it’s especially useful when you get stuck. Plus, it’s free! If you’re interested, you’ll find the cohort here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;buildfaast.com&#x2F;#service under the name `Amazon Clone (Intermediate&#x2F;Advanced)`',

        'Hi HN, we’re George, Oscar, and Dan, the founders of Nyckel (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nyckel.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nyckel.com</a>). Nyckel allows developers with no ML experience to train and deploy ML functions to classify images and text with very little training data. We let you go from a few labeled data points to a serverless machine-learned classifier in minutes.<p>The ML-as-a-Service space is dense, including some recent YC companies; so why did we create Nyckel? Our goal is to create a tool that is light, fast, fun, and accessible. Training only takes seconds, you only need 10s of annotations, we avoid ML-lingo and abstract away concepts that make developers feel like outsiders. Our pricing is transparent, signup is instant, and the platform is 100% self-serve.<p>Dan, an experienced engineer without any ML background, was building a social website that required manual curation of user-contributed content. He looked into automating this curation with ML and found offerings that required complicated setup and knowledge of ML concepts. He talked to his AI-researcher friend Oscar, and together they realized that the current solutions were unnecessarily complex and didn’t expose the right developer-friendly abstractions. We think there are many engineers like Dan who leave similar problems unsolved because of the effort required.<p>Using Nyckel, you upload a small (or large) amount of data, annotate a minimum of 2 examples per class, and have a trained model deployed in the cloud and callable via a REST API. All of this happens in seconds. As you use the model, you can continue to improve it by providing more data points as you encounter them. You can also explore and annotate your data in the UI.<p>The Nyckel AutoML engine is based on meta transfer learning. It’s “transfer” because it leverages a large set of pre-trained neural networks to represent your data, and it’s “meta” because we make informed decisions on which of the networks to try based on your particular problem. The design allows for a highly parallel execution where features are extracted and models trained by 100s of compute nodes in parallel requiring only 10s of seconds to train even with 1,000s of samples. We keep abreast of the latest deep-learning networks and add new networks to the system to improve existing and new models. Your trained model is immediately deployed on an elastic inference infrastructure.<p>Our customers are using us to do things like: tag and organize photos in a used-car marketplace; triage customer responses and support tickets for CRM (in multiple languages); determine fake vs real profile pictures to help with user verification; analyze blood sugar charts to suggest corrective actions; and build a barcode-less scanner for bulk foods.<p>Oscar has over 4k scientific citations of his AI research, as well as several industry applications behind him. Dan has designed multiple developer APIs throughout his career, most recently Square’s developer APIs. I led the Functions-as-a-Service team at Oracle Cloud and have extensive experience building large cloud systems. We think that ML, cloud, and API expertise is the right combination for this problem!<p>We have elastic pricing with an always-free tier. Beyond the free tier, we make money when you invoke your function to make a prediction.<p>We&#x27;re really happy we get to show this to you all. Thank you for reading it all! We’d love for you to check us out, and share your thoughts on Nyckel and your experiences in the ML tooling space in general.',

        'Hello people,<p>I was hoping for some opinions from some guys and girls who focus more on the backend of applications or full stack developers.<p>I am somewhat mixed up. I am a freelancer and I&#x27;ve developed several projects in Django (and also in Flask) and until now I have always used their template engines and I am happy so far. I combined it with vanilla JS, Jquery, sometimes with AlpineJs and now recently tried HTMX. To be honest, I cannot really complain since I managed to fashion all components to my and my customer&#x27;s liking without any major drawbacks. Although I have to be honest and say that I sometimes have pushed AlpineJs a bit too much, beyond its original purpose of just sprinkles.<p>The applications I build are mostly for SMEs to automate some of their tasks. For me to stay sane and to get the project done in time I strive for simplicity in terms of project architecture.<p>But everywhere I go I read about React or Vue and I absolutely understand that they have their purposes and are game-changing in some fields, no doubt. Now, I always wonder for myself, should I learn a front-end framework? Will I end up as a a jack of all trades and just create one messy application after another?<p>AlpineJs, HTMX, etc. are very much manageable to master in a foreseeable time but every time I try to sit down and start with Vue &#x2F; React I am faced with so many new variables (NPM, NodeJs, Typescript, Webpack, etc.) that I think I have to learn for at least half a year till I just understand what is going on. Specially as a freelancer I have to be able to fix things fast by myself if the shit hits the fan.<p>Now, does it make sense to learn Vue&#x2F;React as a solo programmer or just to stick with the small frameworks like AlpineJs&#x2F;HTMX? At what point do you consider a frontend framework essential and not just a feature?<p>Thanks in advance.',
